<h2><a name="AMONG_THE_PINES" id="AMONG_THE_PINES"></a>AMONG THE PINES.</h2>

<h3>[CONCLUDED.]</h3>

<p>'My God! drowned herself and her child!' exclaimed the Colonel, with
deep emotion.</p>

<p>'Come, my friend, let us go to them at once,' I said, laying my hand on
his arm, and drawing him unresistingly away.</p>

<p>A pair of mules was speedily harnessed to a large turpentine-wagon, and
the horses we had ridden the day before were soon at the door. When the
Colonel, who had been closeted for a few minutes with Madam P&mdash;, came
out of the house, we mounted and rode off with the 'corn-cracker.'</p>

<p>The native's farm was located on the stream which watered my friend's
plantation, and was about ten miles distant. Taking a by-road which led
to it through the woods, we rode rapidly on in advance of the wagon.</p>

<p>'Sort o' likely gal, thet, warn't she?' remarked the turpentine-maker,
after a while.</p>

<p>'Yes, she was,' replied the Colonel, in a half-abstracted manner,
'<i>very</i> likely.'</p>

<p>'Kill harself 'case har man war shot by thet han'som overseer uv yourn?'</p>

<p>'Not altogether for that, I reckon,' replied my host,' I fear the main
reason was her being put at field-work, and abused by the driver.'</p>

<p>'Thet comes uv not lookin' arter things yerself, Cunnel. I 'tend ter my
niggers parsonally, and they keer a durned sight more fur this world
then fur kingdom-cum. Ye cudn't hire 'em ter kill 'emselves fur no
price.'</p>

<p>'Well,' replied the Colonel, in a low tone, 'I <i>did</i> look after her. I
put her at full field-work myself.'</p>

<p>'By&mdash;!' cried the native, reining his horse to a dead stop, and speaking
in an excited manner; 'I doan't b'lieve it, 'taint 't all like ye; yer a
d&mdash;d seceshener&mdash;thet comes uv yer bringin'-up; but ye've a soul
bigger'n a meetin'-house, and ye cudn't hev put thet slim, weakly gal
inter th' woods, no how!'</p>

<p>The Colonel and I instinctively halted our horses, as the 'corn-cracker'
stopped his.</p>

<p>'It is true, Barnes,' said my host, in a low voice, 'I <i>did</i> do it!'</p>

<p>'May God Almighty furgive ye, Cunnel,' said the native, starting his
horse forward, '<i>I</i> wudn't hev dun it fur all yer niggers, by&mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>The Colonel made no reply, and we rode on the rest of the way in
silence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p><p>The corn-cracker's house&mdash;a low, unpainted, wooden building&mdash;stood near
the little stream, and in the centre of a cleared plot of some ten
acres. This plot was surrounded by a post and rail fence, and in its
front portion was a garden, which grew a sufficient supply of vegetables
to serve a family of twenty persons. In the rear, and at the sides of
the dwelling, were about seven acres, devoted mainly to corn and
potatoes. In one corner of the lot were three tidy-looking negro-houses,
and close beside them I noticed a low shed, near which a large quantity
of the stalks of the tall, white corn, common to that section, was
stacked in the New-England fashion. Browsing on the corn-stalks were
three sleek, well-kept milch-cows and a goat.</p>

<p>About four hundred yards from the farmer's house, and on the bank of the
little run, which there was quite wide and deep, stood a
turpentine-distillery, and around it were scattered a large number of
rosin and turpentine barrels, some filled and some empty. A short
distance higher up, and far enough from the 'still' to be safe in the
event of a fire, was a long, low, wooden shed, covered with rough,
unjointed boards, placed upright, and unbattened. This was the
'spirit-house,' used for the storage of the spirits of turpentine when
barreled for market, and awaiting shipment. In the creek, and filling
nearly one-half of the channel in front of the spirit-shed, was a raft
of pine-timber, on which were laden some two hundred barrels of rosin.
On such rude conveyances the turpentine-maker sent his produce to
Conwayboro. There the timber-raft was sold to my wayside friend, Captain
B&mdash;, and its freight shipped on board vessel for New-York.</p>

<p>Two 'prime' negro men, dressed in the usual costume, were 'tending the
still,' and a negro-woman, as stout and strong as the men, and clad in a
short, loose, linsey gown, from beneath which peeped out a pair of
coarse leggins, was adjusting a long wooden trough, which conveyed the
liquid rosin from the 'still' to a deep excavation in the earth, at a
short distance. In the pit was a quantity of rosin sufficient to fill a
thousand barrels.</p>

<p>'Here, Bill,' said Barnes to one of the negro men, as we pulled up at
the distillery, 'put these critters up, and give 'em some oats, and when
they've cooled off a bit, water 'em.'</p>

<p>'Yas, yas, massa,' replied the negro, springing nimbly forward, and
taking the horses by the bridles, 'an' rub 'em down, massa?'</p>

<p>'Yas, rub 'em down right smart,' replied the corn-cracker; then turning
to me, as we dismounted, he said: 'Stranger, thet's th' sort o' niggers
fur ye; all uv mine ar' jess like him, smart and lively as kittens.'</p>

<p>'He does seem to go about his work cheerfully,' I replied.</p>

<p>'Cheerfully! d&mdash;d ef he doan't&mdash;all on 'em du! They like me better'n
thar own young 'uns, an' it's 'case I use 'em like human bein's;' and he
looked slyly toward the Colonel, who just then was walking silently
away, in the direction of the run, as if in search of the drowned
'chattels.'</p>

<p>'Not thar, Cunnel,' cried the native, 'they're inter th' shed,' and he
started to lead the way to the 'spirit-house.'</p>

<p>'Not now, Barnes,' I said, putting my hand on his arm, 'leave him alone
for a little while. He is feeling badly, and we'd better not disturb
him.'</p>

<p>The native motioned me to a seat on a rosin-barrel, as he replied:</p>

<p>'Wal, he 'pears ter, thet's a fact, and he orter. D&mdash;d ef it arn't
wicked to use niggers like cattle, as he do.'</p>

<p>'I don't think he means to ill-treat them; he's a kind-hearted man.'</p>

<p>'Wal, he ar' sort o' so; but he's left ev'ry thing ter thet d&mdash;d
overseer uv his'n. I wudn't ha' trusted him to feed my hogs.'</p>

<p>'Hogs!' I exclaimed, laughing; 'I supposed you didn't <i>feed</i> hogs in
these diggings. I supposed you 'let 'em run.''</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> doan't; an' I've got th' tallest porkys 'round har.'</p>

<p>'I've been told that they get a good living in the woods.'</p>

<p>'Wal, p'raps the' du jest make eout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> ter live thar; but my ole 'oman
likes 'em ter hum. They clean up a place like, eat up all th' leavin's,
an' give th' young nigs suthin' ter du.'</p>

<p>'It seems to me,' I said, resuming the previous thread of the
conversation, 'that overseers are a necessity on a large plantation.'</p>

<p>'Wal, the' ar', an' thet's why thar ortent ter be no big plantations;
God Almighty didn't make human bein's ter be herded togethar in th'
woods. No man orter ter hev more'n twenty on 'em&mdash;he can't look arter no
more himself, an' it's agin natur' ter set a feller over 'em what han't
no int'rest in 'cm, an' no feelin' fur 'em, an' who'll drive 'em round
like brutes. I never struck one on 'em in my life, an' my ten du more'n
ony fifteen th' Cunnel's got.'</p>

<p>'I thought they needed occasional correction. How do you manage them
without whipping?'</p>

<p>'Manage them! why, 'cordin' ter scriptur'&mdash;do ter 'em as I'd like ter be
dun ter, ef I war a nigger. Every one on 'em knows I'd part with my last
shirt, an' live on taters an' cow-fodder, 'fore I'd sell 'em; an' then I
give 'em Saturdays for 'emselfs; but thet's cute dealin' in me, (tho'
th' pore, simple souls doan't see it,) fur ye knows the' work thet day
fur 'emselfs, an' raise nigh all thar own feed, 'cept th' beef and
whisky, an' it sort o' makes 'em feel like folks, too, more like as ef
the' war <i>free</i>&mdash;the' work th' better fur it all th' week.'</p>

<p>'Then you think the blacks would work better if free?'</p>

<p>'In <i>course</i> I does&mdash;it's agin man's natur' to be a slave. Thet lousy
parson ye herd ter meetin' a Sunday, makes slavery eout a divine
institooshun, but my wife's a Bible 'oman, and she says 'tan't so; an'
I'm d&mdash;d ef she arn't right.'</p>

<p>'Is your wife a South-Carolina woman?'</p>

<p>'No, she an' me's from th' old North&mdash;old Car'tret, nigh on ter
Newbern&mdash;an' we doan't take nat'rally to these fire-eaters.'</p>

<p>'Have you been here long?'</p>

<p>'Wal, nigh on ter six yar. I cum har with nuthin' but a thousan' ter my
back, slapped thet inter fifteen hun'red acres, paid it down, and then
hired ten likely North-Car'lina niggers, hired 'em with th' chance uv
buyin' ef the' liked eout har. Wal, th' nigs all know'd me, and the'
sprung ter it like blazes; so every yar I've managed ter buy two on 'em,
and now I've ten grow'd up, and thar young uns, th' still and all th'
traps paid fur, an' ef this d&mdash;d secesh bisness hadn't a come 'long, I'd
hev hed a right smart chance o' doin' well.'</p>

<p>'I'm satisfied secession will ruin the turpentine business; you'll be
shut up here, unable to sell your produce, and it will go to waste.'</p>

<p>'Thet's my 'pinion; but I reckon I kin manage now witheout turpentine.
I've talked it over 'long with my nigs, and we kalkerlate ef these ar
doin's go eny furder, ter tap no more trees, but cl'ar land an' go ter
raisin' craps.'</p>

<p>'What! do you talk politics with your negroes?'</p>

<p>'Nary a politic; but I'm d&mdash;d ef th' critters doan't larn 'em sumhow.
The' knows 'bout as much uv what's goin' on as I du; but plantin' arn't
politics, it's bisness, an' they've more int'rest in it nor I hev,
'cause they've sixteen mouths ter feed agin my four.'</p>

<p>'I'm glad, my friend, that you treat them like men; but I have supposed
they were not well enough informed to have intelligent opinions on such
subjects.'</p>

<p>'Informed! wal, I reckon the' is; all uv mine kin read, an' sum on 'em
kin write, too. D'ye see that little nig thar?' pointing to a juvenile,
coal-black darky of about six years, who was standing before the 'still'
fire; 'thet ar little devil kin read an' speak like a parson. He's got
hold, sumhow, uv my little gal's book o' pieces, an' larned a dozen on
'em. I make him cum inter th' house, once in a while uv an evenin', an'
speechify, an' 'twould do yer soul good ter har him, in his shirt-tail,
with a old sheet wound round him fur a toger (I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> told him th'
play-actors du it so down ter Charles'on,) an' spoutin' out: 'My name am
Norval; on de Gruntin' hills my fader feed him hogs!' The little coon
never seed a sheep, an' my wife's told him a flock's a herd, an' he
thinks 'hog' <i>sounds</i> better'n 'flock,' so, contra'y ter th' book, he
puts in 'hogs,' and hogs, you knows, hev ter grunt, so he gits 'em on
th' Gruntin' hills;' and here the kind-hearted native burst into a fit
of uproarious laughter, in which, in spite of myself, I had to join.</p>

<p>When the merriment had somewhat subsided, the turpentine-maker called
out to the little darky:</p>

<p>'Come here, Jim.'</p>

<p>The young chattel ran to him with alacrity, and wedging in between his
legs, placed his little black hands in a free-and-easy way on his
master's knees, and looking up trustfully in his face, said:</p>

<p>'Wal, massa?'</p>

<p>'What's yer name?'</p>

<p>'Dandy Jim, massa.'</p>

<p>'Thet arn't all; what's th'rest?'</p>

<p>'Dandy Jim of ole Car'lina.'</p>

<p>'Who made ye?'</p>

<p>'De good God, massa.'</p>

<p>'No, he didn't; God doan't make little nigs. He makes none but white
folks,' said the master, laughing.</p>

<p>'Yas, he'm do; missus say he'm do; dat he make dis nig jess like he done
little Totty.'</p>

<p>'Wal, he did, Jim. I'm d&mdash;d ef <i>He</i> didn't, fur nobody else cud make
<i>ye!</i>' replied the man, patting the little wooly head with undisguised
affection.</p>

<p>'Now, Jim, say th' creed fur 'de gem-man.''</p>

<p>The young darky then repeated the Apostles' Creed and the Ten
Commandments.</p>

<p>'Is thet all ye knows?'</p>

<p>'No, massa, I knows a heap 'sides dat.'</p>

<p>'Wal, say suthin' more; sum on 'em pieces thet jingle.'</p>

<p>The little fellow then repeated with entire correctness, and with
appropriate gestures and emphasis, though in the genuine darky
dialect&mdash;which seems to be inborn with the pure, Southern black&mdash;Mrs.
Hemans' poem:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'The boy stood on the burning deck.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>'Mrs. Hemans draped in black!' I exclaimed, laughing heartily; 'How
would the good lady feel, could she look down from where she is, and
hear a little darky doing up her poetry in that style?'</p>

<p>'D&mdash;d ef I doan't b'lieve'twud make her love th' little nig like I do,'
replied the corn-cracker, taking him up on his knee as tenderly as he
would have taken up his own child.</p>

<p>'Tell me, my little man,' I said, 'who taught you all these things?'</p>

<p>'I lamed 'em myseff, sar,' was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>'You learned them yourself! but who taught you to read?'</p>

<p>'I larned 'em myseff, sar!'</p>

<p>'You couldn't have learned <i>that</i> yourself; didn't your 'massa' teach
you?'</p>

<p>'No, sar.'</p>

<p>'Oh! your 'missus' did?'</p>

<p>'No, sar.'</p>

<p>'No, sar!' I repeated; then suspecting the real state of the case, I
looked him sternly in the eye, and said: 'My little man, it's wrong to
tell lies, you must <i>always</i> speak the truth; now, tell me truly, did
not your 'missus' teach you these things?'</p>

<p>'No, sar, I larned 'em myseff.'</p>

<p>'Ye can't cum it, stranger; ye moight roast him over a slow fire, an'
not git nary a thing eout on him but thet,' said the corn-cracker,
leaning forward, and breaking into a boisterous fit of laughter. 'It's
agin th' law, an' I'm d&mdash;d ef <i>I</i> teached him. Reckon he <i>did</i> larn
himself!'</p>

<p>'I must know your wife, my friend. She's a good woman.'</p>

<p>'Good! ye kin bet high on thet; she's uv th' stuff th' Lord makes angels
eout on.'</p>

<p>I had no doubt of it, and was about to say so, when the Colonel's
turpentine-wagon drove up, and I remembered I had left him too long
alone.</p>

<p>The coachman was driving, and Jim sat on the wagon beside him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>'Massa K&mdash;,' said the latter, getting down and coming to me, 'Whar am
dey?'</p>

<p>'In the spirit-shed.'</p>

<p>He was turning to go there, when I called him back, saying: 'Jim, you
must not see your master now; you'd better keep out of sight for the
present.'</p>

<p>'No, massa; de ma'am say de Cunnel take dis bery hard, and dat I orter
tell him I'se sorry for what I'se done.'</p>

<p>'Well, wait awhile. Let me go in first.'</p>

<p>Accompanied by the corn-cracker, I entered the turpentine-shed. A row of
spirit-barrels were ranged along each of its sides, and two tiers
occupied the centre of the building. On these a number of loose planks
were placed, and on the planks lay the bodies of the metif woman and her
child. The Colonel was seated on a barrel near them, with his head
resting on his hands, and his eyes fixed on the ground. He did not seem
to notice our entrance, and passing him without speaking, I stepped to
the side of the dead.</p>

<p>The woman's dress, the common linsey gown worn by her class, was still
wet, and her short, kinky, brown hair fell in matted folds around her
head. One arm hung loosely by her side; the other was clasped tightly
around her child, which lay as if asleep on her bosom. One of its small
hands clung to its mother's breast, and around its little lips played a
smile. But how shall I describe the pale, sweet beauty of the face of
the drowned girl, as she lay there, her eyes closed, and her lips
parted, as in prayer? Never but once have I seen on human features the
strange radiance that shone upon it, or the mingled expression of hope
and peace and resignation that rested there, and that was in the
long-gone time when, standing by her bedside, I watched the passing away
of one who is now an angel in heaven!</p>

<p>'Come, my dear friend, let us go,' I said, turning and gently taking the
Colonel by the arm, 'the negroes are here, and will take charge of the
dead.'</p>

<p>'No, no!' he replied, rising and looking around as if aroused from a
troubled dream; 'that is for <i>me</i> to do!' Then he added, after a
moment's pause, 'Will you help me to get them into the wagon?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I will, certainly.'</p>

<p>He made one step toward the body of the dead girl, then sinking down
again on the barrel, covered his face with his hands, and cried out: 'My
God! this is terrible! Did you ever see such a look as that? It will
haunt me forever!'</p>

<p>'Come, my friend, rouse yourself&mdash;this is weakness; you are tired with
the long ride and excitement of the past few days. Come, go home; I will
look after them.'</p>

<p>'No, no! I must do it. I will be a man again;' and he rose and walked
steadily to the dead bodies. 'Is there any one here to help?' he asked.</p>

<p>Jim was standing in the doorway, and I motioned to him to come forward.
The great tears were streaming down his face, as he stepped timidly
toward his master, and said: 'I'll do dis, massa, don't you trubble
yerself no more.'</p>

<p>'It's good of you, Jim. You'll forgive me for being so cruel to you,
won't you?' said the Colonel, taking the black by the hand.</p>

<p>'Forgib ye, massa! <i>I</i> war all ter blame; but ye'll forgib me,
massa&mdash;ye'll forgib me!' cried the black, with strong emotion.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; but say no more about it. Come, let us get Julie home.'</p>

<p>But the poor girl was already <i>home</i>&mdash;home where her sufferings and her
sorrows were over, and all her tears were wiped away forever!</p>

<p>We four bore away the mother and the child. A number of blankets were in
the bottom of the wagon, and we laid the bodies carefully upon them.
When all seemed ready, the Colonel, who was still standing by the side
of the dead, turned to my new friend, and said: 'Barnes, will you loan
me a pillow? I will send it back to-night.'</p>

<p>'Sartin, Cunnel,' and the farmer soon brought one from the house.
Lifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> tenderly the head of the drowned girl, the Colonel placed it
beneath her, and smoothing back her tangled hair, he gently covered her
face with his handkerchief, as if she could still feel his kindness, or
longer cared for the pity or the love of mortal. Yet, who knows but that
her parted soul, from the high realm to which it had soared, may not
then have looked down, have seen that act, and have forgiven him?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the first moments of grief the sympathy of friends and the words of
consolation bring no relief. How much more harshly do such words grate
on the ear when the soul is bowed down by remorse and unavailing regret!
Then the wounded spirit finds peace nowhere but with God.</p>

<p>I saw that the Colonel would be alone, and turning to him, as he
prepared to follow the strange vehicle which, with its load of death,
was already jolting its way over the rough forest road, I said:</p>

<p>'Will you pardon me, if I remain with your friend here for a while? I
will be at the mansion before dark.'</p>

<p>'Oh! certainly, my friend; come when you feel disposed,' he replied, and
mounting his horse, he was soon out of sight among the trees.</p>

<p>'Now, Barnes,' I said, shaking off the gloomy feelings that had
oppressed me; 'come, I must see that wife of yours, and get a glimpse of
how you live.'</p>

<p>'Sartin, stranger; come in. I'll give ye th' tallest dinner my 'oman can
scare up, an' she's sum pumkins in th' cookin' line;' and he led the way
to the farm-house.</p>

<p>As I turned to follow, I slipped a half-dollar into the hand of the
darky who was holding my horse, and asked him to put her again into the
stable.</p>

<p>'I'll do dat, sar; but I karn't take dis; massa doan't 'low it nohow,'
he replied, tendering me back the money.</p>

<p>'Barnes, your negroes have strange ways; I never met one before who'd
refuse money.'</p>

<p>'Wal, stranger,'tan't hosspetality to take money on yer friends, and
Bill gets all he wants from me.'</p>

<p>I took the silver and gave it to the first darky I met, who happened to
be an old centenarian belonging to the Colonel. As I tossed it to him,
he grinned out: 'Ah! massa, I'll git sum 'backer wid dis; 'pears like I
hadn't nary a chaw in furty yar.' With more than one leg in the grave,
the old negro had not lost his appetite for the weed: in fact, that and
whisky are the only 'luxuries' ever known to the plantation black.</p>

<p>As we went nearer, I took a closer survey of the farm-house. It was, as
I have said, a low, unpainted, wooden building, located in the middle of
a ten-acre lot. It was approached by a straight walk, paved with a
mixture of sand and tar, similar to that which the reader may have seen
in the Champs Elys&eacute;es. I do not know whether my backwoods friend or the
Parisian pavior was the first inventor of this composition; but I am
satisfied the corn-cracker had not stolen it from the stone-cracker. The
walk was lined with fruit-bearing shrubs, and directly in front of the
house were two small flower-beds.</p>

<p>The dwelling itself, though of a dingy-brown wood-color, was neat and
inviting. It may have been forty feet square on the ground, and was only
a story and a half high; but a projecting roof and a front dormer-window
relieved it from the appearance of disproportion. Its gable ends were
surmounted by two enormous brick chimneys, carried up on the outside, in
the fashion of the South, and its high, broad windows were ornamented
with Venetian blinds. Its front door opened directly into the
'living-room,' and at the threshold we met its mistress. As the image of
that lady has still a warm place in a pleasant corner of my memory, I
will describe her. She was about thirty years of age, and had a fresh,
cheerful face. To say that she was handsome, would not be strictly true;
though she had that pleasant, gentle, kindly expression that sometimes
makes even a homely person seem beau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>tiful. But she was not homely. Her
features were regular, her hair glossy and brown, and her eyes black and
brilliant, and for their color, the mildest and softest I had ever seen.
Her figure was tall, and in its outline somewhat sharp and angular; but
she had an ease and grace about her that made one forget she was not
molded as softly and roundly as others. She seemed just the woman on
whose bosom a tired, worn, over-burdened man might lay his weary head,
and find rest and forgetfulness.</p>

<p>She wore a neat calico dress, fitting closely to the neck, and an apron
of spotless white muslin. A little lace cap perched cosily on the back
of her head, hiding a portion of her wavy, dark hair, and on her feet&mdash;a
miracle, reader, in one of her class&mdash;were stockings and shoes! Giving
me her hand&mdash;which, at the risk of making her husband jealous, I held
for a moment&mdash;she said, making a gentle courtesy:</p>

<p>'Ye ar welcome, stranger.'</p>

<p>'I sincerely thank you, madam; I <i>am</i> a stranger in these parts.'</p>

<p>She tendered me a chair; while her husband opened a sideboard, and
brought forth a box of Havanas and a decanter of Scuppernong. As I took
the proffered seat, he offered me the refreshments. I drank the lady's
health in the wine, but declined the cigars. Seeing this, she remarked:</p>

<p>'Yer from th' North, sir, arn't ye?'</p>

<p>'Yes, madam, I live in New-York; but I was born in New-England.'</p>

<p>'I reckoned so; I knew ye didn't belong in Car'lina.'</p>

<p>'How did you know that, madam?' I asked, laughing.</p>

<p>'I seed ye doan't smoke 'fore wimmin. But ye mustn't mind me; I sort o'
likes it; it's a great comfut to John, and may be it ar to ye.'</p>

<p>'Well, I do relish a good cigar; but I never smoke before any lady
except my wife, and though she's only 'a little lower than the angels,'
she <i>does</i>, once in a while, say it's a shame to make the <i>house</i> smell
like a tobacco-factory.'</p>

<p>Barnes handed me the box again, and I took one. As I was lighting it, he
said:</p>

<p>'Ye've got a good 'oman, hev ye?'</p>

<p>'There's none better; at least, I think so.'</p>

<p>'Wal, I'm 'zactly uv thet 'pinion 'bout mine; I wouldn't trade her fur
all this worle an' th' best half uv t'other.'</p>

<p>'Don't ye talk so, John,' said the lady. Then addressing me, she added:
'It's a good husband thet makes a good wife, sir.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes, madam, but not always, I've known some of the best of wives
who had miserable husbands.'</p>

<p>'An' I'm d&mdash;d ef <i>I</i> made my wife th' 'oman she ar',' said the
corn-cracker.</p>

<p>'Hush, John, ye mustn't swar so; ye knows how often ye've said ye
wouldn't.'</p>

<p>'Wal, I du, an' I won't agin, by&mdash;.' But Sukey, whar's th' young uns?'</p>

<p>'Out in the lot, I reckon; but ye mustn't holler'm in&mdash;they'r all dirt.'</p>

<p>'No matter for that, madam,' I said, 'dirt is healthy for little ones;
rolling in the mud makes them grow.'</p>

<p>'Then ourn orter grow right smart, fur they'r in it allers.'</p>

<p>'How many have you, madam?'</p>

<p>'Two; a little boy, four, and a little gal, six.'</p>

<p>'They're of interesting ages.'</p>

<p>'Yas, the' is int'restin'; ev'ry uns own chil'ren is smart; but the'
does know a heap. John was off ter Charl'ston no great while back, an'
the little boy used ter pray ev'ry mornin' an' ev'nin' fur his fader ter
cum hum. I larned 'em thet jest so soon as the' talked, 'cause thar's no
tellin' how quick the' moight be tooken 'way. Wal, the little feller
prayed ev'ry mornin' an' ev'nin' fur his fader ter cum back, and John
didn't cum; so finarly he got sort o' provoked with th' Lord, an' he
said God war aither deaf an' couldn't har or he war naughty an' wouldn't
tell fader thet little Johnny wanted to seed 'im 'werry mooch,'' and
here the good lady laughed pleasantly, and I joined in most heartily.</p>

<p>Blessed are the children that have such a mother!</p>

<p>Soon the husband returned with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> little girl and boy and four young
ebonies, all bare-headed and all dressed alike, in thick trowsers and a
loose linsey shirt. Among them was my new acquaintance, 'Dandy Jim, of
ole Car'lina.'</p>

<p>The little girl came to me, and soon I had two white children on one
knee and two black on the other, with Dandy Jim between my legs, playing
with my watchchain. The family made no distinction between the colors,
and as the children were all equally clean, I did not see why <i>I</i> should
do so.</p>

<p>The lady renewed the conversation by remarking: 'P'raps ye reckon it's
quar, sir, that we 'low ourn to 'sociate 'long with th' black chil'ren;
but we karn't help it. On big plantations, it works sorry bad, fur th'
white young uns larn all manner of evil from the black uns; but I've
laboored ter teach ourn so one won't do no harm ter t'other.'</p>

<p>'I suppose, madam, that is one of the greatest evils of slavery. The low
black poisons the mind of the white child, and the bad influence lasts
through life.'</p>

<p>'Yas, it's so, stranger; an' it's the biggest keer I hev. It often
'pears strange ter me thet our grow'd up men arn't no wuss than the'
is.'</p>

<p>In those few words, that unlettered woman had said what would&mdash;if men
were but wise enough to hear and heed the great truth which she
spoke&mdash;banish slavery from this continent forever!</p>

<p>After a while, the farmer told the juvenile delineator of Mrs. Hemans
and the other poets to give us a song; and planting himself in the
middle of the floor, the little darky sang 'Dixie' and several other
negro songs, which his master had taught him, but into which he had
introduced some amusing variations of his own. The other children joined
in the choruses; and then Jim danced breakdowns, 'walk-along-Joes,' and
other darky dances, his master accompanying him on a cracked fiddle,
till my sides were sore with laughter, and the hostess begged them to
stop. Finally the clock struck twelve, and the farmer, going to the
door, gave a long, loud blast on a cow's horn. In about five minutes,
one after another of the field hands came in, till the whole ten had
seated themselves on the verandah. Each carried a bowl, a tin-cup, or a
gourd, into which my host&mdash;who soon emerged from a back room<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with a
pail of whisky in his hand&mdash;poured a gill of the beverage. This was the
day's allowance, and the farmer, in answer to a question of mine, told
me he thought negroes were healthier and worked better for a small
quantity of alcohol daily. 'The' work hard, and salt feed doan't set 'em
up 'nough,' was his remark.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hostess busied herself with preparations for dinner, and
it was soon spread on a bright cherry table, covered by a spotless white
cloth. The little darkies had scattered to the several cabins, and we
soon sat down to as good a meal as I ever ate at the South.</p>

<p>We were waited on by a tidy negro woman, neatly clad in a calico gown,
with shoes on her feet, and a flaming red and yellow kerchief on her
head. This last was worn in the form of a turban, and one end escaping
from behind and hanging down her back, it looked for all the world like
a flag hung out from a top turret. Observing it, my host said:</p>

<p>'Aggy&mdash;showin' yer colors? Ye'r Union gal&mdash;hey?'</p>

<p>'Yas, I is dat, massa; Union ter de back-bone,' responded the negress,
grinning widely.</p>

<p>'All th' Union <i>ye</i> knows on,' replied the master, winking slyly at me,
'is th' union yer goin' ter hitch up 'long with black Cale over ter
Squire Taylor's.'</p>

<p>'No, 'tan't, massa; takes more'n tu ter make de Union.'</p>

<p>'Yas, I knows; it gin'rally takes ten or a dozen: reckon it'll take a
dozen with ye.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>'John, ye mustn't talk so ter th' sarvents; it spiles 'em,' said his
wife.</p>

<p>'No it doan't; do it, Aggy?'</p>

<p>'Lor', missus, I doan't keer what massa say; but I doan't leff no oder
man run on so ter me!'</p>

<p>'No more'n ye doan't, gal! only Cale.'</p>

<p>'Nor him, massa; I makes him stan' 'roun', <i>I</i> reckon.'</p>

<p>'I reckon ye du; ye wudn't be yer massa's gal ef ye didn't.'</p>

<p>When the meal was over, I visited with my host the negro houses. The
hour allowed for dinner<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was about expiring, and the darkies were
preparing to return to the field. Entering one of the cabins, where were
two stout negro men and a woman, my host said to them, with a perfectly
serious face:</p>

<p>'Har, boys, I've fetched ye a live Yankee ab'lishener; now, luk at 'im
all roun'. Did ye ever see sech a critter?'</p>

<p>'Doan't see nuffin' quar in dat gemman, massa,' replied one of the
blacks. 'Him 'pears like bery nice gemman; doan't 'pear like
ab'lishener;' and he laughed and scraped his head in the manner peculiar
to the negro, as he added: 'Kinder reckon he wudn't be har ef he war one
of <i>dem</i>.'</p>

<p>'What der <i>ye</i> knows 'bout th' ab'lisheners? Ye never seed one; what
d'ye 'spose the' luk like?'</p>

<p>'Dey say dey luk likes de bery ole debil, massa; but reckon 'tan't so.'</p>

<p>'Wal, the' doan't; the' luk wuss then thet; they'm bottled up thunder
an' lightnin', an' ef the' cum down har, they'll chaw ye all ter hash.'</p>

<p>'I reckon!' replied the darky, manipulating his wool and distending his
face into a decidedly incredulous grin.</p>

<p>'What do you tell them such things for?' I asked good-humoredly.</p>

<p>'Lor' bless ye, stranger, the' knows th' ab'lisheners ar thar friends,
jest so well as ye du; and so fur as thet goes, d&mdash;d ef the' doan't know
I'm one on 'em myseff, fur I tells 'em ef the' want to put the' kin put,
an' I'll throw thar trav'lin 'spenses inter th' bargin. Doan't I tell ye
thet, Lazarus?'</p>

<p>'Yas, massa; but none ob massa's nigs am gwine ter put&mdash;lesswise, not so
long as you an' de good missus am 'bove groun'.'</p>

<p>The darky's name struck me as peculiar, and I asked him where he got it.</p>

<p>'<i>'Tan't</i> my name, sar; but you see, sar, w'en massa fuss hire me ob ole
Capt'in &mdash;&mdash;, up dar ter Newbern-way, I war sort o' sorry like&mdash;hadn't
no bery good cloes&mdash;an' massa he den call me Lazarus, 'case he say I war
all ober rags and holes, an' it hab sort o' stuck ter me eber sense. I
war a'mighty bad off 'fore dat, but w'en I cum down har I gets inter
Abr'am's buzzum, I does,' and here the darky actually reeled on his seat
with laughter.</p>

<p>'Is this woman your wife?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No, sar; my wife 'longs to Cunnel J&mdash;&mdash;; dat am my new wife&mdash;my ole
wife am up dar whar I cum from.'</p>

<p>'What! have you two wives?'</p>

<p>'Yas, massa, I'se two.'</p>

<p>'But that's contrary to Scripture?'</p>

<p>'No, sar; de Cunnel say 'tan't. He say in Scriptur' dey hab a heap ob
'em, and dat niggers kin hab jess so many as dey likes&mdash;a hun'red ef dey
want ter.'</p>

<p>'Does the Colonel teach that to his negroes?' I asked, turning to the
native.</p>

<p>'Yas, I reckon he do, an' sits 'em th' 'zample, too,' he replied,
laughing; 'but th' old sinner knows better'n thet; he kin read.'</p>

<p>'Do you find that in the Bible, Lazarus?'</p>

<p>'Yas, massa, whar I reads it. Dat's whar it tell 'bout David and Sol'mon
and all em&mdash;dey hab a heap ob wives. A pore ole darky karn't hab nuffin'
'sides dem, an' he <i>orter</i> be 'low'd jess so many as he likes.'</p>

<p>Laughing at the reasoning of the negro, I asked:</p>

<p>'How would <i>you</i> like it, if your wife over at Colonel J&mdash;&mdash;'s had as
many husbands as <i>she</i> liked?'</p>

<p>'Wal, I couldn't fine no fault, massa; an' I s'pose she do, dough I
doan't knows it, 'case I'se dar only Sundays.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>'Have you any children?'</p>

<p>'Yas, sar, Ise free 'longin' ter de Cunnel, an' four or five&mdash;I doan't
'zactly know&mdash;up ter hum; but <i>dey'se</i> grow'd up.'</p>

<p>'Is your wife up there married again?'</p>

<p>'Yas, massa, she got anoder man jess w'en I cum 'way; har ole massa make
har do it.'</p>

<p>We then left the cabin, and when out of hearing of the blacks, I said to
the corn-cracker: 'That <i>may be</i> Scripture doctrine, but <i>I</i> have not
been taught so.'</p>

<p>'Scriptur' or no Scriptur', stranger, it's d&mdash;&mdash;d heathenism,' replied
the farmer, who, take him all in all, is a superior specimen of the
class of small planters at the South; and yet, seeing polygamy practiced
by his own slaves, he made no effort to prevent it. He told me that if
he should object to his darky cohabiting with the Colonel's negress, it
would be regarded as unneighborly, and secure him the enmity of the
whole district! And still we are told that slavery is a <i>divine</i>
institution!</p>

<p>After this, we strolled off into the woods, where the hands were at
work.</p>

<p>They were all stout, healthy, and happy-looking, and in answer to my
comments on their appearance, the native said that the negroes on the
turpentine-farms are always stronger and longer-lived than those on the
rice and cotton-fields. Unless carried off by the fevers incident to the
climate, they generally reach a good old age, while the rice-negro
seldom lives to be over forty, and the cotton-slave very rarely attains
sixty. Cotton-growing, however, my host thought, is not, in itself, much
more unhealthy than turpentine-gathering, though cotton-hands work in
the sun, while the turpentine-slaves labor altogether in the shade.</p>

<p>'But,' he said, 'the' work 'em harder nor we does, an' doan't feed 'em
so well. We give ourn meat and whisky ev'ry day, but them articles is
skarse 'mong th' cotton blacks, an' th' rice niggers never get 'em
excep' ter Christmas-time, an' thet cums but onst a yar.'</p>

<p>'Do you think the white could labor as well as the black, on the rice
and cotton-fields?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yas, an' better&mdash;better any whar; but, in coorse, 'tain't natur' fur
black nor white ter stand long a workin' in th' mud and water up ter
thar knees; sech work would kill off th' very devil arter a while. But
th' white kin stand it longer nor the black, and it's 'cordin' ter
reason that he shud; for, I reckon, stranger, that the spirit and pluck
uv a man hev a durned sight ter du with work. They'll hole a man up when
he's clean down, an' how kin we expec' thet th' pore nig, who's nary a
thing ter work fur, an who's been kept under an' 'bused ever sense Adam
was a young un'&mdash;how kin we expec' he'll work like men thet own
'emselfs, an' whose faders hev been free ever sense creation? I reckon
that the parient has a heap ter du with makin' th' chile. He puts the
sperit inter 'im: doan't we see it in hosses an' critters an' sech like?
It mayn't crap eout ter onst, but it's shore ter in th' long run, and
thet's th' way th' black han't no smarter nor he is. He's been a-ground
down an' kept under fur so long thet it'll take more'n 'un gin'ration
ter bring him up. 'Tan't his fault thet he's no more sperit, an' p'raps
'tan't ourn&mdash;thet is, them on us as uses 'em right&mdash;but it war the fault
uv yer fader an' mine&mdash;yer fader stole 'em, and mine bought 'em, an'
the' both made cattle uv 'em.'</p>

<p>'But I had supposed the black was better fitted by nature for hard
labor, in a hot climate, than the white.'</p>

<p>'Wal, he arn't, an' I knows it. Th' d&mdash;&mdash;d parsons an' pol'tishuns say
thet, but 'tan't so. I kin do half agin more work in a day then th' best
nig I've got, an' I've dun it, tu, time an' agin, an' it didn't hurt me
nuther. Ye knows ef a man hev a wife and young 'uns 'pendin' on him, an'
arn't much 'forehanded, he'll work like th' devil. I've dun it, an' ye
hev ef ye war ever put ter it; but th' nigs, why, the' han't got no
wives and young 'uns ter work fur&mdash;the law doan't 'low 'em ter have
any&mdash;the' han't nary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> a thing but thar carcasses, an' them's thar
masters'.'</p>

<p>'You say a man works better for being free; then you must think 'twould
be well to free the negroes.'</p>

<p>'In coorse, I does. Jest luk at them nigs o' mine; they're ter all
'tents an' purposes free, 'case I use 'em like men, an' the' knows the'
kin go whenever the' d&mdash;&mdash;d please. See how the' work&mdash;why, one on 'em
does half as much agin as ony hard-driv' nigger in creation.'</p>

<p>'What would you do with them, if they were <i>really</i> free?'</p>

<p>'Du with 'em? why, hire 'em, an' make twice as much eout on 'em as I
does now.'</p>

<p>'But I don't think the two races were meant to live together.'</p>

<p>'No more'n the' warn't. But 'tan't thar fault thet they's har. We han't
no right to send 'em off. We orter stand by our'n an' our faders'
doin's. The nig keers more fur his hum, so durned pore as it ar', then
ye or I does fur our'n. I'd pack sech off ter Libraria or th' devil, as
wanted ter go, but I'd hev no 'pulsion 'bout it.'</p>

<p>'Why, my good friend, you're half-brother to Garrison. You don't talk to
your neighbors in this way?'</p>

<p>'Wal, I doan't;' he replied, laughing. 'Ef I dun it, they'd treat me to
a coat uv tar, and ride me out uv th' deestrict raather sudden, I
reckon; but yer a Nuthener, an' the' all take nat'rally ter freedum,
excep' th' d&mdash;&mdash;d doughfaces, an' ye aren't one on 'em, I'll swar.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm not. Do many of your neighbors think as you do?'</p>

<p>'Reckon not many round har; but up in Cart'ret, whar I cum from, heaps
on 'em do, though the' darn't say so.'</p>

<p>By this time we had reached the still, and directing his attention to
the enormous quantity of rosin that had been run into the pit which I
have spoken of, I asked him why he threw so much valuable material away.</p>

<p>'Wal, 'tan't wuth nothin' har. Thet's th' common, an' it won't bring in
York, now, more'n a dollar forty-five. It costs a dollar an' two bits
ter get it thar an' pay fur sellin on it, an' th' barr'l's wuth the
difference. I doan't ship nuthin wuss no No. 2.'</p>

<p>'What is No. 2?'</p>

<p>He took the head from one of the barrels, and with an adze cut out a
small piece, then handing me the specimen, replied:</p>

<p>'Now hole thet up ter th' sun. Ye'll see though it's yaller, its clean
and clar. Thet's good No. 2, what brings now two dollars an' two bits in
New-York, an' pays me 'bout a dollar a barr'l; it's got eout o' second
yar dip, an' as it comes eout uv th' still, is run through thet ar
strainer,' pointing to a coarse wire-sieve that lay near. 'Th' common
rosum, thet th' still's runnin' on now, is made eout on th' yaller
dip&mdash;thet's th' kine o' turpentine thet runs from th' tree arter two
yar's tappin'&mdash;we call it yallar dip 'case it's allers dark. We doan't
strain common 'tall, an' it's full uv chips and dirt. It's low now, but
ef it shud ever git up, I'd tap thet ar' heap, barr'l it up, run a
little fresh-stilled inter it, an' 'twould be a'most so good as new.'</p>

<p>'Then it is injured by being in the ground.'</p>

<p>'Not much; it's jest as good fur ev'ry thing but makin' ile, puttin' it
in the 'arth sort o' takes th' sap eout on it, an' th' sap's th' ile.
Natur' sucks thet eout, I s'pose, ter make th' trees grow&mdash;I expec' my
bones 'ill fodder 'em one on these days.'</p>

<p>'Rosin is put to very many uses.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but common's used mainly for ile and soap; th' Yankees put it
inter hard yaller soap, 'case it makes it weigh, an' yer folks is up ter
them doin's, and he looked at me and gave a sly laugh. I could not deny
the 'hard' impeachment, and said nothing. Taking a specimen of very
clear light-colored rosin from a shelf in the still-house, I asked him
what that quality was worth.</p>

<p>'Thet ar brought seven dollars for two hundred an' eighty pounds in
York, airly this yar. It's th' very best No. 1; an' it's hard ter make,
'case ef th' still gets overhet it turns it a tinge. Thet sort is run
through two sieves, the coarse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> 'un, an' thet ar,' pointing to another
wire strainer, the meshes of which were as fine as those of the
flour-sieve used by housewives.</p>

<p>'Do your seven field-hands produce enough 'dip' to keep your still a
running?'</p>

<p>'No, I buys th' rest uv my naboors who han't no stills; an' th' Cunnel's
down on me 'case I pay 'em more'n he will; but I go on Franklin's
princerpel: 'A nimble sixpence's better'n a slow shillin'. A great ole
feller thet, warn't he? I've got his life.'</p>

<p>'And you practice on his precepts; that's the reason you've got on so
well.'</p>

<p>'Yas, thet an' hard knocks. The best o' doctrins arn't wuth a d&mdash;&mdash;n ef
ye doan't work on 'em.'</p>

<p>'That is true.'</p>

<p>We shortly afterward went to the house, and there I passed several hours
in conversation with my new friend and his excellent wife. The lady,
after a while, showed me over the building. It was well-built,
well-arranged, and had many conveniences I did not expect to find in a
backwoods dwelling. She told me its timbers and covering were of
well-seasoned yellow pine&mdash;which will last for centuries&mdash;and that it
was built by a Yankee carpenter, whom they had ''ported' from
Charleston, paying his fare, and giving him his living and two dollars
and a half a day. It had cost as near as she 'cud reckon, 'bout two
thousan' dollars.'</p>

<p>It was five o'clock, when, shaking them warmly by the hand, I bade my
pleasant friends 'good-by,' and mounting my horse rode off to the
Colonel's.</p>

<p>The family were at supper when I returned to the mansion, and, entering
the room, I took my accustomed place at the table. None present seemed
disposed to conversation. The little that was said was spoken in a low,
subdued tone, and no allusion was made to the startling event of the
day. At last the octoroon woman asked me if I had met Mrs. Barnes at the
farmer's.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I replied, 'and I was greatly pleased with her. She seems one of
those rare women who would lend grace to even the lowest station.'</p>

<p>'She <i>is</i> a rare woman; a true, sincere Christian. Every one loves her;
but few know all her worth; only those do who have gone to her in sorrow
and trial, as&mdash;&mdash;' and her voice trembled, and her eyes moistened&mdash;&mdash;
'as I have.'</p>

<p>And so that poor, outcast, despised, dishonored woman, scorned and cast
off by all the world, had found one sympathizing, pitying friend. Truly,
'He tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.'</p>

<p>When the meal was over, all but Madam P&mdash;&mdash; retired to the library.
Tommy and I fell to reading, but the Colonel shortly rose and continued
pacing up and down the apartment till the clock sounded eight. The lady
then entered, and said to him:</p>

<p>'The negroes are ready, David; will <i>you</i> go, Mr. K&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'I think not, madam,' I replied; 'at least not now.'</p>

<p>I continued reading, for a time, when, tiring of the book, I laid it
down, and followed them to the little burial-ground.</p>

<p>The grave of Sam was open, and the plantation blacks were gathered
around it. In the centre of the group, and at the head of the rude
coffin, the Colonel was seated, and near him the octoroon woman and her
son. The old preacher was speaking.</p>

<p>'My chil'ren,' he said, 'she hab gone ter Him, wid har chile&mdash;gone up
dar, whar dey doan't sorrer no more, whar dey doan't weep no more, whar
all tears am wiped from dar eyes foreber. I knows she lay han's on
harseff, and dat, my chil'ren, am whot none ob us shud do, 'case we'm de
Lord's; he put us har, an' he'll take us 'way when we's fru wid our
work, not afore. We hab no right ter gwo afore. Pore Juley did&mdash;but
p'raps she cudn't help it. P'raps de great sorrer war so big in har
heart, dat she cudn't fine rest nowhar but in de cole, dark riber.
P'raps she warn't ter blame&mdash;p'raps,' and here his eyes filled&mdash;'p'raps
ole Pomp war all ter blame, fur I tole har, my chil'ren'&mdash;he could say
no more, and sinking down on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> a rude seat, he covered his face, and
sobbed audibly. Even the Colonel's strong frame heaved with emotion, and
not a dry eye was near. After a time the old man rose again, and with
streaming eyes, and upturned face, continued:</p>

<p>'Dar's One up dar, my chil'ren, dat say: 'Come unter me, all ye dat am
weary an' a heaby laden, an' I will gib you ress.' He, de good Lord, he
say dat; an' p'raps Juley hard him say it, an' dat make har gwo.' Again
his voice failed, and he sank down, weeping and moaning as if his heart
would break.</p>

<p>A pause followed, when the Colonel rose, and aided by Jim and two other
blacks, with his own hands nailed down the lid, and lowered the rude
coffin into the ground. Then the earth was thrown upon it, and then the
long, low chant which the negroes raise over the dead, mingling now with
sobs and moans, and breaking into a strange wild wail, went up among the
pines, and floating off on the still night air, echoed through the dark
woods, till it sounded like music from the grave. I have been in the
chamber of the dying; I have seen the young and the beautiful laid away
in the earth; but I never felt the solemn awfulness of death as I did
when, in the stillness and darkness of night, I listened to the wild
grief of that negro group, and saw the bodies of that slave mother and
her child, lowered to their everlasting rest by the side of Sam.</p>

<p>The morning broke bright and mellow with the rays of the winter sun,
which in Carolina lends the warmth of October to the chills of January,
when, with my portmanteau strapped, and my thin overcoat on my arm, I
gave my last 'God bless you' to the octoroon woman, and turned my face
toward home.</p>

<p>Jim shouted, 'All ready,' the driver cracked his whip, and we were on
our way to Georgetown.</p>

<p>The recent rains had hardened the roads, the bridges were repaired, and
we were whirled rapidly forward, and at one o'clock reached Bucksville.
There we met a cordial welcome, and remained to dinner. Our host pressed
us to pass the night at his house, but the Colonel had business with one
of his secession friends residing down the road&mdash;my wayside
acquaintance, Colonel A&mdash;&mdash;, and desired to stay over night with him. At
three o'clock, bidding a kindly farewell to Captain B&mdash;&mdash; and his
excellent family, we were again on our way.</p>

<p>The sun was just sinking among the western pines, when we turned into a
broad avenue, lined with stately old trees, and rode up to the doorway
of the rice-planter. It was a large, square, dingy old house, seated on
a gentle knoll, a short half-mile from the river, along whose banks
stretched the rice-fields. We entered, and were soon welcomed by its
proprietor.</p>

<p>He received my friend warmly, and gave me a courteous greeting,
remarking, when I mentioned that I was homeward bound, that it was wise
to go. 'Things are very unsettled; there's no telling what a day may
bring forth; feeling is running very high, and a Northern man, whatever
his principles, is not safe here. By the way,' he added, 'did you not
meet with some little obstruction at Conwayboro, on your way up?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I did; a person there ordered me back, but when things began to
look serious, Scipio, the negro whom you saw with me, got me out of the
hobble.'</p>

<p>'Didn't he tell the gentleman that you were a particular friend of mine,
and had met me by appointment at Captain B&mdash;&mdash;'s?' he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>'I believe he did, sir; but I assure you, <i>I</i> said nothing of the kind,
and I think the black should not be blamed, under the circumstances.'</p>

<p>'Oh! no; I don't blame him. I think he did a smart thing. He might have
said you were my grandmother, if it would have served you, for that low
fellow is as fractious as the devil, and dead sure on the trigger.'</p>

<p>'You are very good, sir,' I replied; 'how did you hear of it?'</p>

<p>'A day or two afterward, B&mdash;&mdash; passed here on his way to Georgetown. I
had been riding out, and happened to be at the head of my avenue when
he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> was going by. He stopped, and asked if I knew you. Not knowing then
the circumstances, I said that I had met you casually at Bucksville, but
had no particular acquaintance with you. He rode on, saying nothing
further. The next morning I had occasion to go to Georgetown, and at Mr.
Fraser's office accidentally heard that Scip&mdash;who is well known and
universally liked there&mdash;was to have a public whipping that evening.
Something prompted me to inquire into it, and I was told that he had
been charged by B&mdash;&mdash; with shielding a well-known abolitionist at
Conwayboro&mdash;a man who was going through the up-country distributing such
damnable publications as the New-York <i>Independent</i> and <i>Tribune</i>. I
knew, of course, it referred to you, and that it wasn't true. I went to
Scip and got the facts, and by stretching the truth a little, finally
got him off. There was a slight discrepancy between my two accounts of
you,' (and here he laughed heartily,) 'and B&mdash;&mdash;, when we were before
the Justice, remarked on it, and came d&mdash;&mdash;d near calling me a liar. It
was lucky he didn't, for if he had he'd gone to h&mdash;&mdash;l before the place
was hot enough for him.'</p>

<p>'I can not tell you, my dear sir, how grateful I am to you for this. It
would have pained me more than I can express, if Scip had suffered for
doing a disinterested kindness to me.'</p>

<p>Early in the morning we were again on our way, and twelve o'clock found
us seated at a dinner of bacon, corn-bread, and waffles, in the 'first
hotel' of Georgetown. The Charleston boat was to leave at three o'clock;
and, as soon as dinner was over, I sallied out to find Scip. After a
half-hour's search I found him on 'Shackelford's wharf,' engaged in
loading a schooner bound for New-York with a cargo of cotton and
turpentine.</p>

<p>He was delighted to see me, and after I told him I was going home, and
might never see him again, I took his hand warmly in mine, and said:</p>

<p>'Scip, I have heard of the disgrace that was near being put upon you on
my account, and I feel deeply the disinterested service you did to me;
now, I <i>can not</i> go away without doing <i>something</i> for you&mdash;showing you
in <i>some</i> way that I appreciate and <i>like</i> you.'</p>

<p>'I likes <i>you</i>, massa,' he replied, the tears coming to his eyes; 'I tuk
ter you de bery fuss day I seed you, 'case, I s'pose'&mdash;and he wrung my
hand till it ached&mdash;'you pitied de pore brack man. But you karnt do
nuffin fur <i>me</i>, massa; I doan't want nuffin; I doan't want ter leab
har, 'case de Lord dat put me har arn't willin' I shud gwo. But you kin
do suffin, massa, fur de pore brack man, an' dat'll be doin' it fur
<i>me</i>, 'case my heart am all in dat. You kin tell dem folks up dar, whar
you lib, massa, dat we'm not like de brutes, as dey tink we is. Dat we's
got souls, an' 'telligence, an' feelin's, an' am men like demselfs. You
kin tell 'em, too, massa&mdash;'case you's edication, and kin talk&mdash;how de
pore wite man am kep' down har; how he'm ragged, an' starvin', an' ob no
account, 'case de brack man am a slave. How der chil'ren can't get no
schulein', how eben de grow'd-up ones doan't know nuffin&mdash;not eben so
much as de pore brack slave, 'case de 'stockracy want dar votes, an
cudn't get 'em ef dey 'low'd 'em larnin'. Ef your folks know'd all de
truf&mdash;ef dey know'd how boff de brack an' de pore w'ite man, am on de
groun', an' can't git up, ob demselfs&mdash;dey'd do suffin&mdash;dey'd break de
Constertution&mdash;dey'd do <i>suffin</i> ter help us. I doan't want no one
hurted, I doan't want no one wronged; but jess tink ob it, massa, four
million ob bracks, an' nigh so many pore w'ites, wid de bressed Gospil
shinin' down on 'em, an' dey not knowin' on it. All dem&mdash;ebry one ob
'em&mdash;made in de image ob de great God, an' dey driven roun' an' 'bused
wuss dan de brutes. You's seed dis, massa, wid your own eyes, an' you
kin tell 'em on it; an' you <i>will</i> tell 'em on it, massa;' and again he
took my hand while the tears rolled down his cheeks; 'an' Scip will
bress you fur it, massa&mdash;wid his bery lass breaf he'll bress you; an' de
good Lord will bress you, too, massa; he will foreber bress you, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
he'm on de side ob de pore an' de 'flicted; his own book say dat, an' it
am true, I knows it, fur I feels it <i>har</i>;' and he laid his hand on his
heart, and was silent.</p>

<p>I could not speak for a moment. When I mastered my feelings, I said: 'I
<i>will</i> do it Scip; as God gives me strength, I <i>will</i>.'</p>

<p>Reader, I am keeping my word.</p>

<p>This is not a work of fiction. It is a record of facts, and therefore
the reader will not expect me to dispose of its various characters on
artistic principles&mdash;that is, lay them away in one of those final
receptacles for the creations of the romancer&mdash;the grave and matrimony.
Death has been among them, but nearly all are yet doing their work in
this breathing, busy world.</p>

<p>The characters I have introduced are real. They are not drawn with the
pencil of fancy, nor, I trust, colored with the tints of prejudice. The
scenes I have described are true. I have taken some liberties with the
names of persons and places, and, in a few instances, altered dates; but
the events themselves occurred under my own observation. No one
acquainted with the section of country I have described, or familiar
with the characters I have delineated, will question this statement.
Lest some one who has not seen the slave and the poor white man of the
South, as he actually is, should deem my picture overdrawn, I will say
that 'the half has not been told!' If the whole were related&mdash;if the
Southern system, in all its naked ugliness, were fully exposed&mdash;the
truth would read like fiction, and the baldest relation of fact like the
wildest dream of romance.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The overseer was never taken. A letter which I received from Colonel
J&mdash;&mdash;, shortly prior to the stoppage of the mails, informed me that Moye
had succeeded in crossing the mountains into Tennessee, where, in an
interior town, he disposed of the horse, and then made his way by an
inland route to the free States. The horse the Colonel had recovered,
but the overseer he never expected to see. Moye is now, no doubt,
somewhere in the North, and is probably at this present writing a
zealous Union man, of somewhat the same 'stripe' as the conductors of
the New-York <i>Herald</i> and the Boston <i>Courier</i>.</p>

<p>I have not heard directly from Scipio, but one day last July, after a
long search, I found on one of the wharves of South street a coasting
captain who knew him well, and who had seen him the month previous at
Georgetown. He was at that time pursuing his usual avocations, and was
as much respected and trusted as when I met him.</p>

<p>A few days after the tidings of the fall of Sumter were received in
New-York, and when I had witnessed the spontaneous and universal
uprising of the North which followed that event, I dispatched letters to
several of my Southern friends, giving them as near as I could an
account of the true state of feeling here, and representing the utter
madness of the course the South was pursuing. One of these letters went
to my Union acquaintance whom I have called, in the preceding pages,
'Andy Jones.'</p>

<p>He promptly replied, and a pretty regular correspondence ensued between
us, which has continued, at intervals, even since the suspension of
intercourse between the North and the South.</p>

<p>Andy has stood firmly and nobly by the old flag. At the risk of every
thing, he has boldly expressed his sentiments every where. With his life
in his hand and&mdash;a revolver in each of his breeches-pockets, he walked
the streets of Wilmington when the secession fever was at its hight,
openly proclaiming his undying loyalty to the Union, and 'no man dared
gainsay him.'</p>

<p>But with all his patriotism, Andy keeps a bright eye on the 'main
chance.' Like his brother, the Northern Yankee, whom he somewhat
resembles and greatly admires, he never omits an opportunity of 'turning
an honest penny.' In defiance of custom-house regulations and of our
strict blockade, he has carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> on a more or less regular traffic with
New-York and Boston (<i>via</i> Halifax and other neutral ports) ever since
North-Carolina seceded. His turpentine, while it was still his property,
has been sold in the New-York market, under the very eyes of the
government officials, and, honest reader, <i>I</i> have known of it.</p>

<p>By various roundabout means, I have recently received letters from him.
His last, dated in April, and brought to a neutral port by a shipmaster
whom he implicitly trusts, has reached me since the previous chapters
were written. It covers six pages of foolscap, and is written in
defiance of all grammatical and orthographical principles; but as it
conveys important intelligence in regard to some of the persons
mentioned in this narrative, I will transcribe a portion of it.</p>

<p>It gave me the melancholy tidings of the death of Colonel J&mdash;&mdash;. He had
joined the Confederate army, and fell, bravely meeting a charge of the
Massachusetts troops, at Roanoke.</p>

<p>On receiving the news of his friend's death, Andy rode over to the
plantation, and found Madam P&mdash;&mdash; plunged in the deepest grief. While he
was there, a letter arrived from Charleston, with intelligence of the
dangerous illness of her son. This second blow crushed her. For several
days she was delirious and her life despaired of; but throughout the
whole, the noble corn-cracker, neglecting every thing, remained beside
her.</p>

<p>When she returned to herself, and had in a measure recovered her
strength, she learned that the Colonel had left no will; that she was
still a slave, and soon to be sold, with the rest of the Colonel's
<i>personal property</i>, according to law.</p>

<p>This is what Andy writes about the affair. I give the letter as he wrote
it, merely correcting the punctuation and enough of the spelling to make
it intelligible:</p>

<p>'W'en I hard thet th' Cunnel hadent leff no wil, I was hard put what ter
dew; but arter thinkin' on it over a spell, I knowed shede har on it
sumhow; so I 'cluded to tell har miseff. She tuk on d&mdash;&mdash;d hard at fust,

<p>Such is Andy's letter. Misspelled and profane though it be, I would not
alter a word or a syllable of it. It deserves to be written in

the world. And it <i>is</i> written in the sky&mdash;in the great record book&mdash;and
it will be read when you and I, reader, meet the assembled universe, to

<h3>VI.</h3>

<h3><a name="ON_THE_PINCIO" id="ON_THE_PINCIO"></a>ON THE PINCIO.</h3>


<p>With that wise foresight, shared by all European rulers, the Roman
Pincio was undoubtedly wedded to its purpose of keeping the idle ones
very busy at the very time of day when revolutionary plots find the best
hearing&mdash;before dinner. Whirling around its walks in carriages, or
gently promenading under trees, among rose-bushes, and by fountains,
while a large band of musicians play with spirit fine selections from
the last operas, or favorite airs from old ones; the eye gratified by
the sight of pleasant faces, or dwelling enraptured on the beautiful
landscape spread before it&mdash;how can the brain disengage itself to think
of Liberty, won through toil and battle, only to be preserved by
self-denial and moral strength?</p>

<p>But the traveler who travels only to travel, and has the means and
spirit to find pleasure wherever he goes, thinking only of what he sees,
enjoys to its fullest extent the luxurious seat of the hired,
white-damask-lined carriage, drawn by stalwart, heavy-limbed, coal-black
horses, with sweeping tails, the white foam flying from the champed
silver bits, the whole turn-out driven by a handsome, white-gloved,
black-coated Roman. In solemn state and swiftly, he winds up the zig-zag
road leading from the piazza Popolo, (so-called from <i>popolo</i>, a
poplar-tree, and not as the English will have it, from <i>popolo</i>, the
people,) and at last reaches the summit of Roman ambition&mdash;the top of
the Pincian hill. He passes other carriages filled with other strangers
like himself, or with titled and fashionable Romans, and finally, his
carriage drawn up to one side of the broad drive in front of the
semi-circle where the band plays, he descends, to walk around and chat
with the friends he may find there.</p>

<p>Toward sunset the scene is full of animation. The sabres of the cavalry
soldiers, on guard to prevent infraction of rules, gleam brightly; the
old infantry soldiers are darting here and there, chasing away sundry
ownerless dogs, who always make it a point to promenade the Pincio; the
Italian nurses from Albano, or at least dressed in Albanese costume,
shine conspicuous in their crimson-bodiced dresses; Englishmen going
through their constitutional; Frenchmen mourning for the Champs Elys&eacute;es;
artists in broad-brim hats smoking cigars; Americans observing Italy, so
as to be like Italians; ladies of all nations commanding the attention
of mankind as they sweep along the hard-rolled gravel-walks; smiles,
bows, looks of love, indignation, affection, coquetry; faces reflective
of great deeds and greater dinners ... every face bright in the lambent
amber light that streams from the sun dipping his head preparatory to
putting on his night-cap, and bidding Rome <i>felicissima notte!</i> a most
happy night.</p>

<p>Over the irregular walls of the subdued white and mellow gray houses and
palaces, beyond the Tiber running red in the dying sunlight, over the
round-walled castle of San Angelo, the dome of Saint Peter's rises full
in the midst of the twinkling, hazy, red and golden light. Passing the
stone-pines crowning Monte Mario, there gleam away to the left the far
waters of the sea, over which the purple mist of young night tenderly,
softly falls. Once thoughtfully noted, you will remember this glowing
scene years after sublimer and wilder views are lost to memory or grown
so faint that they are to you but as dull colors seen in dreams of old
age compared to the flashing brightness of those presented to the closed
eyes of youth.</p>

<p>As the sun sets and those in carriages and on foot slowly leave the
hights of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> the Pincio, and descend once more to the old city, you will
hear, as the evening star shines brighter and brighter, the first
liquid, thrilling notes of the nightingales; then as you lean over the
stone parapet, dreamily looking into the dense foliage of trees and
shrubs beneath you, you will feel the beauty of those lines:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seek the nightingale's sequestered tower,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who with her love-lorn melody</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So bewitched thee in the vernal hour:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When she ceased to love, she ceased to be.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is from the months of May to November, when travelers have left Rome,
and the city is in the hands of the Romans, that your walks on the
Pincio will prove something more than a mere repetition of a stroll in
Baden-Baden, or a revival of ideas common to the Prado or Prater. No
longer the little prettinesses of the Medicean Venus flirt by you in the
nervous silks that flutter along these walks, but something nobly
womanly, of a solid past, slow and stately, moves solemnly, by. We know
the lives of these copies of the Venus of Milos, we know its most
commonplace and vulgar attributes, but we know, too, its strength! The
city of Rome holds in its women the mothers of heroes, when Providence
shall withdraw the black veil now hung over their rude minds, and let in
the light of knowledge. We who laugh at their sad ignorance, think what
we would be without liberty&mdash;our minds enslaved, geography tabooed!
Egypt is a paradise compared to Rome.</p>

<p>The advantages of foreign travel to an intelligent American are to teach
him ... the disadvantages of living any where save in America. And
though the artistic eye dwells with such loving repose on the soothing
colors of Italy, and particularly on the subdued white and gray tones of
Roman ruins and palaces, walls and houses, yet the owner of that
artistic eye should restrain his wrath at the fiery red bricks of our
own cities, for let him reflect that this color goads him on, as it doth
a bull, to make valorous efforts&mdash;to do something!</p>

<p>Looking down from the stone balustrade of the Pincio on the piazza
Popolo, we note two churches, one on either side of the Corso; their
architecture is neither more nor less hideous than nine tenths of the
other three hundred and odd churches of Rome; the same heavy,
half-cooked look about doors and windows, suggesting cocked-hats of the
largest size on the heads of dwarfs of no size at all; the same heavy
scroll-work, reminding one of the work of a playful giant of a
green-grocer who has made a bouquet of sausages and cabbages, egg-plants
and legs of mutton, and exhibits it to a thick-headed public as a&mdash;work
of art. O Roman <i>Plebs!</i> lay this nattering unction to your soul&mdash;we did
not do that!</p>

<p>The history of all nations seem to indicate successive ages of grub and
butterfly-life; certainly Rome has been a grub long enough. Let us hope
the sun of Victor Emmanuel, the King of Gallant Men, will hasten the
time when the Romans shall wing their way to the light of Liberty. These
mockeries of architecture shall then stand as warning fingers to the
Romans of the sad days that were; the days when mind and body were
enslaved, and the grinning monkey held the dove tight-clutched in his
brutal grasp. Through sword and fire public taste must pass before it is
purified: the mountain-stream, dashing along with bounding steps, is
clear and sparkling, but in the long stretch of level pastureland or
prairie it is still and&mdash;dirty.</p>

<p>It may be well to descend and wander through those close and narrow
streets where the waste-water of old Roman aqueducts makes green and
damp the foundation stories of gloomy houses, and where the
carefully-nurtured traveler sees sights of smoked interiors, dirt and
rubbish in the streets, that terrify him; but let him remember that in
the worst of these kennels the inhabitants have never forgotten that
they had a Past, and the 'I am a Roman Citizen!' still rings in their
ears, eats into their hearts, and is at their tongue's end. Monsieur
About was in Rome when Caper was there; he saw these Romans through
Napoleonic spectacles: while one foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> was trying to stamp on Antonelli
gently, the other was daintily ascending the shining steps leading to
the temple of Gallic fame. He is impressed with the idea that the Romans
are hangers-on of hangers-on to patricians, from which we are to infer,
if the patricians are ever hung, there will be a heavy weight to their
feet!</p>

<p>Rocjean, one afternoon, after a walk on the Pincio, was returning to his
studio, when, as he descended to the Via Babuino, he met a Roman artist
named Attonito, who cultivated the English.</p>

<p>'Ow arr you toe-day, my dear?' he asked Rocjean.</p>

<p>'Quite well, except a slight attack of bad English, from which I hope to
recover in a few minutes.'</p>

<p>'Pray tell unto me th-hat weech is bad Englis.'</p>

<p>'Haven't you been on the Pincio?'</p>

<p>'Yas, I tak' consteetutionails up there avery afternoons; it is a
costume Englis' th-hat I vary moche cotton to.'...</p>

<p>'W-hat! Cotton to? Why, that is a clear Americanism; where did you pick
it up?'</p>

<p>'Meester Caper of Noo-York, he told unto me it am more elegant as to
say, I love, or I affection. Bote, 'ave you saw that bu-tee-fool
creechure with 'air of flags?'...</p>

<p>'What!'</p>

<p>''Air of flags; 'ow you name eet? <i>Capellatura di lino?</i>'</p>

<p>'Oh! you mean tow-head?'</p>

<p>'Toe! no, no! I mean <i>lino</i>.'</p>

<p>'Ah! yes, flaxen hair.'</p>

<p>'<i>Benissimo!</i> Vary well, flagson 'air and blue eyze. Shhe was in
carri-adge with Lady Blumpudy. I go avery afternoons to inspect her as
she takes the airs on the Pincio, Eet would gife me great pleasures to
ally myself to her in marriage compact, bote I do not know eef she has a
fortune. Do you know any theengs?'</p>

<p>'Yes, a great many; one of which is that it is my dinner-time, and as I
turn down the Condotti&mdash;good afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Goo-ood by, my dear,' answered Attonito, as he slowly wandered up the
Piazza di Spagna.</p>

<p>Another example of the beneficial effects of the Pincio on the
<i>bourgeoise</i>, thought Rocjean. When will the alarm-bell in the clock of
Roman time ring out its awaking peal?</p>

<h3><a name="ROME_BY_NIGHT" id="ROME_BY_NIGHT"></a>ROME BY NIGHT.</h3>


<p>If one would realize the romantic side of Rome in all its stately
grandeur, and receive a solemn and ineffaceable impression of its
beauty, by all means let him, like Quevedo's hero, sleep 'a-daytime' and
do his sight-seeing by moonlight or star-light; for, save in some few
favored quarters, its inspection by gaslight would be difficult.
Remember, too, that all that is grandly beautiful of Rome, the traveler
has seen before he reaches the Imperial City&mdash;with the eyes of
understanding, with the eyes of others&mdash;in books.</p>

<p>Nothing but a heap of old stones, bricks, and mortar is there here for
the illiterate tourist&mdash;he can have six times as jolly a time in Paris
for half the money that he pays 'in that old hole where a fellow named
Culius J&aelig;sar used to live.'</p>

<p>As if the night were not sufficiently dark in this city, there are
always those who stand ready with the paint-brush of fancy to make it
even of a darker hue; whisperings among the travelers in hotels of
certain Jim Joneses or Bill Smiths who have been robbed. Yes, sir, early
in the evening, right there in the Corso: grabbed his watch and chain,
struck him on the head. You know he was a powerfully built man; but they
came behind him, and if he hadn't have done so and so, the rascally
Italians would have killed him, and so forth.</p>

<p>'Re-al-ly; well, you won't catch me out at nights!'</p>

<p>There rises up, as I write, the figure of a slim young man, of the
day-time negro-minstrel style of beauty, who once dwelt three weeks in
Rome. I know that he was profound in knowledge of trick and vice, and
that he had an impediment in his speech&mdash;he could never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> speak the
truth. He told a fearful tale of a midnight robbery in the Piazza di
Spagna&mdash;himself the victim. It was well told, and I ought to know, for I
read it years before in a romance, only the scene was, in type, laid in
Venice. According to this negro-minstrel style of youth, he had been
seized from behind, held, robbed of watch and elegant gold chain, red
coral shirt-studs, onyx sleeve-buttons, and a porte-monnaie containing
fifty scudi, etc., etc. He was the theatrical hero of the hotel for two
days, and the recipient of many drinks. Time, the cater of things, never
digested this falsehood, and months after the youth had left, I learned
that he had lost all his jewelry and money at&mdash;twenty-deck poker.</p>

<p>A few nights after Caper was domiciled in the Via Babuino, Rocjean
called on him, and as he entered his room, carefully extinguished a
taper, and was putting it in his pocket, when Caper asked him what that
was for?</p>

<p>'That! it's a <i>cerina</i>. Have you been two weeks in Rome, and not found
out that? Why, how did you get up-stairs at night?'</p>

<p>'There was a lamp in the entry.'</p>

<p>'None there to-night, so I had to light this. It's only a long piece of
wick, dipped in wax; you see you can roll it up in a ball, and carry it
in your pocket, so! Without this and a box of matches, you can never
hope to be a good Roman. You must have seen that where the houses have
any front-doors, three quarters of them are open all night long; for, as
on every floor of a house, there live different families, they find it
saves trouble&mdash;trouble is money in Rome&mdash;to leave the door unclosed.
These dark entries, for they are seldom lighted, offer a grand chance
for intrigues, and when you have lived here as long as I have, you will
find out that they&mdash;improve the chances. A <i>cerina</i>, in addition to
keeping you from breaking your neck, by tumbling down stone stairs,
gives light to avoid the stray dogs that sleep around loose, and to see
if there is any enemy around who wants to give you a few inches of cold
steel. You may laugh at robbers here; but you may cry for mercy in vain
to a Roman who seeks <i>vendetta</i>&mdash;revenge, you know. Bad way to use
foreign words; but we all do it here. Speak an Italianized English after
a time, the effect of had examples. But come, if you want to see Rome by
moonlight, it's time we were off.'</p>

<p>As they reached the street, Caper asked Rocjean where he could buy the
<i>cerina</i>.</p>

<p>'At any <i>dragheria</i>' said the latter.</p>

<p>'Good, there is a druggist's store up the street&mdash;Borioni's.'</p>

<p>'A <i>dragheria</i> means a grocery-store in Rome. If you want molasses,
however, you must go to the <i>farmacia</i> for it, [that is the Roman for
druggist's shop,] and you will buy it by the ounce.'</p>

<p>'Live and learn,' said Caper, as they entered the grocery and bought the
<i>cerina</i>-price, one baioccho a yard.</p>

<p>'And now let us walk out to Saint Peter's, and see the church by
moonlight.'</p>

<p>'The want of sidewalks in this city,' remarked Rocjean, 'compelling the
Romans to walk over cobble-stones, undoubtedly is the cause of the large
feet of the women, added to their dislike of being in pain from tight
shoes or boots. For genuine martyrdom from tight shoes, French, Spanish,
and Americans&mdash;but chiefly Cubans&mdash;next to Chinese women, are ahead of
the world.'</p>

<p>'But apart from the fact that they do walk on the narrow sidewalks in
the Corso, I have noticed that in the side-streets, even where there is
a foot-walk, nobody takes advantage of it at night.'</p>

<p>'For a good reason, as we shall probably see,' said Rocjean,' before we
reach the bridge of San Angelo. But keep close to me in the middle of
the street.'</p>

<p>The moonlight shone brightly down the narrow street they were then
walking through, which, but for this, the occasional dim light of an
oil-lamp hung in front of a shrine, the light from a wine or grocery
shop, and the ruddy blaze of a charcoal-fire, where chestnuts were
roasting for sale, would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> dark indeed. The ground-floor of
very few Roman houses is ever occupied as a dwelling-place; it is given
up to shops, stables, etc., the families residing, according to their
wealth, on the lowest up to the highest stories; the light purses going
up and the heavy ones sinking. They had walked nearly to the end of this
street, when, happening to look up at the fourth story of a house, he
saw something white being reversed in the moonlight, and the next
instant a long stream of water, reminding him of the horse-tail fall in
Switzerland, came splashing down where a sidewalk should have been.</p>

<p>'What do you think of the middle of the street now?' asked Rocjean.</p>

<p>'Let's stick to it, even if we stick in it. I'm going to buy an
umbrella, <i>and spread it too</i>, when I go out of nights, after this.'</p>

<p>They reached the bridge of San Angelo, and studied for a short time the
fine effect of the moonlight shining on the turbid, slow-flowing Tiber,
and lighting up the heavy pile of the castle of San Angelo. Then they
reached the Piazza of Saint Peter's, and here the scene was imperial.
Out and in through the semi-circular arcade of massive pillars the
moonlight stole to sleep upon the soft-toned, gray old pavement, or was
thrown in dancing, sparkling light from the two noble jets of water
tossed in the clear night-air by the splashing fountains. In all its
gigantic proportions rose up, up into the clear blue of the spangled
sky, the grand thought of Michael Angelo&mdash;the dome of Saint Peter's.</p>

<p>Returning from Saint Peter's, Rocjean proposed to walk through the
Trastevere, the other side of the Tiber, and to cross over the river by
the ponte R&oacute;tto or broken bridge. They found the street along the river
very quiet; here and there a light showed, as on the other side, a
wine-shop or coffee-room; but the houses had few lights in them, and
spite of the moonlight, the streets looked gloomy and desolate.</p>

<p>'They seem to keep dark this side of the river,' said Caper.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered Rocjean, 'and live light. They go to bed for the most
part early, and rise early; they economize fifty-one weeks in a year, in
order to live like lords for the fifty-second&mdash;that is Carnival-week.
Then you shall see these queenly Trasteverine in all their bravery,
thronging the Corso. But here is a clean-looking wine-shop, let us go in
and have a foglietta.'</p>

<p>They found the shop full of thirsty Romans&mdash;it is safe to say
that&mdash;although the number of small flasks showed they could not indulge
their taste so deeply as they wished to. The centre of the listening
group of Romans, was a bright-eyed, black, curly-haired man, who was
reciting, with loud emphasis:</p>


  <h3>THE LIFE AND DEATH</h3>

  <h4>OF THE PERFIDIOUS ASSASSIN,</h4>

  <h3>ARRIGO GARBETINGO OF TRENTO,</h3>

  <p class='center'>Who slew nine hundred and sixty-four grown
  persons and six children.<br /><br /></p>


<p>He had already got through his birth and wicked childhood, and had
arrived at that impressive part where he commences his career of brigand
at large, accompanied by a 'bool-dog':</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'He had a bull-dog of the English breed, oh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More savage than all others that we've seen, oh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close at his side it always walked, indeed, oh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never barked! but then his bite was keen, oh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When on some poor man straight he sprung, take heed, oh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His soul from body quickly fled, I ween, oh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because with cruel, gnashing teeth he tore, oh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him all to pieces, in a manner sore, oh!'</span><br />
</p>

<p>The reciter here stopped to drink another tumbler of wine, upon which
Caper and Rocjean, having finished their pint, paid their scot and
departed.</p>

<p>'Was that an improvisatore?' asked Caper.</p>

<p>'He might pass for such with a stranger of inflammable imagination, who
didn't know the language,' answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> Rocjean. 'He is, in fact, a
reciter, and you can buy the poh, poh-em he was reciting at any of the
country fairs, of the man who sells rosaries and crucifixes. It is one
of the cent-songs of the Papal States, published <i>con licenza</i>, with
license; and a more cruel, disgusting, filthy, and demoralizing tendency
than it must have on the people can not well be imagined; and there are
hundreds of worse.'</p>

<p>While Rocjean was talking they had crossed the ponte R&oacute;tto, and as he
finished his sentence they stood in front of the ruined house of&mdash;Cola
di Rienzil, 'Redeemer of dark centuries of shame&mdash;the hope of Italy,
Rienzi, last of Romans!'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Rocjean, as he halted in front of the ruined house, and
looked carefully at the ornamented stones still left, 'when Saint
Peter's church shall be a circus, this house shall be a shrine.'</p>

<p>'That being the state of the case,' spoke Caper, 'let us walk up to the
Trevi fountain and see the effect by moonlight of its flashing waters,
and inhale the flavor of fried fish from the adjacent stands.'</p>

<p>They stood in front of the wild waters dashing, sparkling over the grand
mass of tumbled rocks reared behind the wall of a large palace. Neptune,
car, horses, tritons, all, stone as they were, seemed leaping into life
in the glittering rays of the moonlight, and the rush and splash of the
waters in the great basin below the street, contrasted with the silence
of the city, left a deep impression of largeness and force on the minds
of the two artists.</p>

<p>'Let us go down and drink the water, for he who drinks of it shall
return again to Rome!'</p>

<p>'With all my heart,' said Caper; 'for if the legend has one word of
truth in it, Garibaldi will be back again some <i>bello giorno</i>&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>Bello giorno</i> means fine day; <i>giorno di bello</i> means a day for war: I
drink to both!' spoke Rocjean, dipping water up in his hand.</p>

<p>They returned to the street, and were walking toward the Piazza di
Spagna, when they overtook two well-dressed men evidently none the
better for too much wine. As they passed them, one of the men said to
the other:</p>

<p>'J-im! I don't see but what we-we-'ll have to r-r-roost out-tall night.
I don't know 'ny 'talian, <i>you</i> don't know 'ny 'talian, we-we-'re
nonpl'sh'd, I'm th-think'ng.'</p>

<p>'Ary borry bout&eacute;re spikinglish?' said the other one to the two artists,
as they were walking on.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Caper, 'four of 'em. If you've lost your way we'll set you
right. Where's your hotel?'</p>

<p>''Tel? Why, 'Tel Europe p'aza Spanya. Are you English?'</p>

<p>'No, sir! I'm an American born, bred and&mdash;buttered,' said Caper.</p>

<p>'B-bullyf'ryou! We'resame spishies&mdash;allrite&mdash;d-driv'on!'</p>

<p>'Look here,' said the one of the two men who was least tipsy, 'if this
tother g-gen'leman and I could stick our heads into c-cold water we'd
come out tall right.'</p>

<p>'It's only a block or two back to the Trevi fountain,' answered Caper,
'and if your friend will go with you, you'll find water enough there.'</p>

<p>They went back to the fountain, and descending the steps with some
difficulty, the two men soon had their heads pretty well cooled off, and
came up with cleared intellects and improved pronunciation. In the
course of conversation it appeared that the two travelers, for such they
were, after rather too much wine at dinner in their hotel, had been
invited to the German Club, where Rhine wine, etc., had finished them
off: attempting to return to their hotel alone, they had lost their way.
As the four walked along, it came out that one of them owned a painting
by Rocjean, and when he discovered that one of his guides was no other
than that Americanized Frenchman, the whole party at once fraternized,
and disregarding any more moonlight effects, walked at once to Caper's
rooms, where over cigars and a bottle of Copalti's wine they signed,
sealed, and delivered a compact to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> a good time generally for the
week the two travelers intended devoting to Rome. The moral of which is
... that you make more friends than meet enemies&mdash;walking round Rome by
night.</p>

<p>They were in the presence of a man with flowing hair, flowing beard, and
flowing language, in a studio, all light from which was excluded by
heavy curtains, except enough to display an easel on which was placed a
painting, a background of dark blue where were many apparently spider
and crow-tracks.</p>

<p>'Those who in the profundity of their darkness incline to the belief
that the vitality of art, butterfly-like, has fled from this sunny
world, have made the biggest kind of a mistake,' said Mr. Artaxerxes
Phlamm, the Mystic Artist, to Caper. The hit was evidently intended for
Rocjean, but that descendant of the Gauls, for some reason, did not
smite back again; he contented himself with the remark:</p>

<p>'Art is long.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' continued Mr. Phlamm, 'not only it has length, but breadth,
breadth, broadness&mdash;it extends from&mdash;yes&mdash;from&mdash;pole to pole.'</p>

<p>'Like a clothes-line,' said Caper.</p>

<p>'Ah!' continued Phlamm, with a pickled smile, 'Fancy, ever Fancy, but it
is Imagination that, as it were, brings man to a level with his destiny
and elevates him to the Olympium hights of the True, and all that rises
much above the meedyochre. But I must not forget that this is your first
visit to me studeeyoh. The painting on the easel is a view of Venice on
the Grand Canal.'</p>

<p>'But,' said Rocjean, 'I do not see the canal.'</p>

<p>'When you are gazing at the stars do you see your boots?' asked Phlamm.</p>

<p>'I always do,' spoke Caper quickly, 'always gaze at 'em at night&mdash;smoke
a cigar&mdash;put my feet higher than my head&mdash;sit in a chair&mdash;stars
reflected in boots&mdash;big thing!'</p>

<p>'You are full of life and spirits, Caper,' continued Phlamm, 'full of
'em; but Rocjean is more serious, more imbued with his nobil calling. My
illustration, as he understands, would convey the idea that such a thing
as foreground in a painting is false; it's a sham, it's a delusion, and
all that. It may do for pre-Raffleites, but for a man who looks Naychure
in the face, he sees her operating diversely, and he works according. I
repeat it again, when I was on the Grand Canal in Venice, I didn't see
the Grand Canal.'</p>

<p>'Neither did I,' spoke Caper, 'we're just alike; I kept my head all the
time out of the gondola-window looking for pretty girls&mdash;and I saw
them!'</p>

<p>'May I ask why you dead-color your canvas blue, and then make your
drawing in black outline?' asked Rocjean.</p>

<p>'What is the color of the sky? Is it not blue? Is not blue a cold color;
is it not the negative to the warmth, the balance to the scales, the one
thing needed on which to rear the glorious fabric that Naychure reveals
to the undimmed vision of man? I know your answer, and I refute it. I
have studied Art from its roots, and now I'm in the branches, and I
grasp the fruit. My manner is peculiar&mdash;I have no patent for it&mdash;I ask
for none. The illimitable passes the legitimate, and the sw-word is
carried by the hero&mdash;for me the bruzh, the paint-bruzh. You see that
painting before you&mdash;it is my child&mdash;I lavish on it my intentions&mdash;I am
going to work three years on that picture!'</p>

<p>'I bet you a new hat you sell it, and a dozen more, and send 'em off
before six months. You're all the rage now since you sold old Goldburg a
picture,' quoth Caper.</p>

<p>'I don't bet, I am opposed to betting. But look that picture of mine in
the face, in the face! Here is a finished painting, The Lake of Zurich;
see those clouds floating mistily away into the far distance&mdash;there's
atmosphere for you&mdash;there's air! You can't cut those clouds into slices
of cheese as you can them of that humbug of a Cloud Lowrain. Cloud
Lowrain! he's a purty painter! Naychure is my teacher. I go out
morn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ings and hear the jackdaws chatter, and see trees and all that;
sometimes I walk around in a garden for ten minutes and commune with
Naychure&mdash;that's the way to do it. Look at clouds before you paint
'em&mdash;I know it's hard when the sun's in your eyes, but do it&mdash;I've spent
a week at a time out-doors, like Wordsworth and the great, the grand,
the colossial Ruzking.'</p>

<p>'I like that water,' said Rocjean, alluding to that of the painting.</p>

<p>'Water is my peculiar study; I am now engaged experimenting on it&mdash;see
there!' Here Phlamm pointed to a basin.</p>

<p>'Been washing your hands?' asked Caper.</p>

<p>'Scientifically experimenting, not manually. Water is
soup-or-fish-all&mdash;earth is not soup-or-fish-all.'</p>

<p>'Our dinners are, during Lent,' quoth Caper, 'unless we're heretics.'</p>

<p>'I don't understand your frivolity&mdash;what do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Didn't you say, 'Soup or all fish?''</p>

<p>'Pshaw! You will never make an artist&mdash;never, never&mdash;<i>you</i> are too, too
superficiall, too much of the earth, dirty.'</p>

<p>'Oh! now I understand,' answered Caper; 'give it to me, I deserve it.'</p>

<p>'I was studying water, its shadows and its superficiality, in that
basin,' continued Phlamm, 'and I study the ocean there, and have
devolved great principles from it. What makes my pictures sought for by
the high and the low, wealthy? What? It's the Truth in 'em, the Mystery,
the Naychure. The old masters were humbugs, they weren't mysterious,
they had no inner sight into the workings of Naychure. Who'd buy one of
their pictures when he might have a Turner for the same price? Nobody.'</p>

<p>'Wouldn't he?' asked Caper. 'Try him with a Raphael, just a small one.'</p>

<p>'Raphael? You mean Raffaele. Ah! he <i>was</i> a painter, he wasn't one of
the old masters, however, he was a middle-age master. What sweetness,
what a kind of&mdash;sweetness generally; what a blending of the prayerful
infant with the enthusiastic beauty; the&mdash;the polished chastity of his
Mad-donas; the folds of his drapery, and&mdash;the drapery of his folds.
Truly enchanting, and so very uncommonly gentlemanly in his colors.'</p>

<p>'The Chesterfield of oil-colors?' suggested Rocjean. 'But <i>&agrave; propos</i> of
Nature, you never paint a picture directly from her, do you?'</p>

<p>'Never! Does a great historical painter use the model? No, sir; he draws
on his imagination for his figures. He scorns to copy from a model. I
convey the impression of mystery that Naychure gives me; I am no servile
copyist. And I claim to leave an impression on the minds of the
beholders of my works. Why, even Caper, I believe, can see what I wish
to tell, and read my poems on canvas. Tell me, Caper, what idea does
even that rough sketch of Venice awake in your imaginative faculties,
and all that?'</p>

<p>Caper's face wore a deeply thoughtful look, as he answered: 'I do see
it; I do claim to read the lesson you would teach&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Speak it out,' interrupted Phlamm, 'I knew you would feel the deep,
mysterious sentiment as is in it.'</p>

<p>'Spider-tracks and crows' feet on the blue mud of a big marsh,' spoke
Caper resolutely.</p>

<p>'Pshaw!' exclaimed Phlamm impetuously; 'you have no Faith, and without
that, all Art is a sealed thing. Goldburg, to whom I lately sold a
painting, had faith; he saw the grand idea which I explained to him in
that picture; he knew that the Earl of Bigbarns had purchased a work of
mine, and he said to me: 'The opinion of such a man is an opinion as
should be a valuable opinion to a business man, and govern the
sentiments of those who worship Art.' Other artists see Naychure, but
<i>how</i> do they see her? I answer, blindly! They don't feel her here!'
(Phlamm struck his waistcoat in fearful proximity to a pocket in it, and
altogether too low for his heart.)</p>

<p>'Nay-chure,' said Caper to Rocjean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> as they left this studio of the
mysterious one, 'ruined a good Barnum to make a poor Phlamm, when she
made him.'</p>

<h3><a name="A_BATH_HUNT" id="A_BATH_HUNT"></a>A BATH-HUNT.</h3>


<p>It is a mournful sight to see a city of one hundred and eighty thousand
five hundred and thirty-nine inhabitants, including one thousand three
hundred and thirty-one priests, two thousand four hundred and four
monks, and eight hundred and fifty-four Jews, Turks, and heretics, as
the census had it, attacked with hydrophobia. But it is so. A
preternatural dread of water rages among all the inhabitants of Rome,
from the untitled down to the titled.</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Rocjean to a distinguished female model, 'I assure you
that, in the sixth century, [or as Sir Gardiner Wilkinson has it, in the
five hundred,] there were nine thousand and twenty-five baths in this
city.'</p>

<p>'Those must have been good times,' replied she, 'for the washerwomen,
<i>seguro!</i> There are a good many clothes of the <i>forestieri</i> [strangers]
washed here now; but not so many different places to wash them in.'</p>

<p>'I mean places to bathe one's self all over in.'</p>

<p>'<i>Mai!</i> Never, never!' exclaimed the woman with horror; 'never! 'twould
give them the fever, kill them dead!'</p>

<p>Mr. Van Brick, of New-York, arriving in Rome early in the morning,
demanded of the porter at the hotel where he could find a <i>bagno</i>, or
place where he could get a bath. He was directed to go down the Babuino,
and at such a number he would find the establishment. Forgetting the
number before he was three steps from the hotel, he inquired of a man
who was driving a she-jackass to be milked, where the bath was. As he
spoke very little Italian, he had to make up by signs what he wanted in
words. The man, probably believing he wanted a church, and that his
motions signified being sprinkled with water, pointed to the Greek
church, and Van Brick, thinking it was a solemn-looking old <i>bagno</i>,
strode in, to his astonishment finding out as soon as he entered that he
was by no means in the right place. As he turned to go out, he saw an
amiable-looking young man, with a black cocked hat in his hand, and a
black serge shirt on that came down to his heels, and had a waist-band
drawing it in over his hips. He asked the young man, as well as he could
in Italian, where there was a <i>bagno</i>.</p>

<p>'The signore is English?' asked the youth in the black shirt.</p>

<p>'I want a bath,' said Van Brick, 'which way?'</p>

<p>'Have patience, signore. There are a great many English in Rome.'</p>

<p>'Farewell!' quoth Van Brick, turning on his heel, reflecting: 'That
youth talks too much; he does it to conceal his ignorance; he don't know
what a bath is.' Coming out of the church, he met a good-natured looking
Roman girl, without any bonnet, as usual, going along with a bottle of
wine and a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me where the bath is?'</p>

<p>'<i>Chi lo sa</i>, signore.'</p>

<p>This CHI LO SA, or, 'who knows?' of the Romans, is a shaft that would
kill Paul Pry. It nearly throws an inquisitive man into convulsions. He
meets it at every turn. The simplest question is knocked to pieces by
it. So common is it for a Roman of the true <i>plebs</i> breed to give you
this for an answer to almost every question, that Rocjean once won a hat
from Caper in this wise: they stood one evening in front of a grocer's
store, down by the Pantheon; it was brilliantly illuminated with
hundreds of candles, displaying piles of hams, cheese, butter, eggs,
etc., etc. Chandeliers constructed of egg-shells, where candles shone
brightly, particularly struck Caper.</p>

<p>'You see,' said Rocjean, 'as anyone else can see, that those chandeliers
are made of egg-shells. Now, I will bet you a hat that I will ask four
men, one after another, who may come to look in this window, what those
chandeliers are made of, and three at least, if not all four of them,
will answer, 'Who knows?' (<i>Chi lo sa.</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>'Done!' said Caper.</p>

<p>Rocjean asked four men, one after another. All four answered; 'Who
knows?'</p>

<p>But to continue the bath-hunt: Van Brick was thrown over by the girl's
answer, and next asked an old woman, who was standing at the door of a
house, buying broccoli from a man with a hand-cart.</p>

<p>'Can <i>you</i> tell me where the bath is?'</p>

<p>'The bath?'</p>

<p>'Yes, the bath.'</p>

<p>'Is it where they boil water for the English?'</p>

<p>'That must be the shop,' quoth Brick.</p>

<p>'That's the place,' pointing with her finger to a house on the opposite
side of the way.</p>

<p>Van Brick crossed over, and after five minutes' hunt over the whole
house, was coming down disheartened, when he saw a pretty girl, about
eighteen years old, standing by the doorway.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me where the bath is?'</p>

<p>'<i>Seguro!</i> I attend to them. You can't have a warm bath for two or three
hours yet, for there is no fire; but you can have a cold one.'</p>

<p>'Well, let me have it as quickly as possible.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. We have no soap for sale, but you can get it two doors off.'</p>

<p>Van Brick went out, and after a time returned with a cake of soap.</p>

<p>'Signore,' said the girl, when he went back, 'the water is all running
out of the hole in the bottom of the tub, and I can't stop it.'</p>

<p>'H'm! Show me the tub; I am a splendid mechanic.'</p>

<p>The hole being stopped, the tub was rapidly filling with water. Van
Brick, in anticipation, was enjoying his bath; when in rushed the
attendant.</p>

<p>'Signore, you will have to wait a few minutes&mdash;until I wash some
towels.'</p>

<p>Van Brick was in extremis. Taking a gold scudo, one of those dear little
one-dollar pieces the Romans call <i>far-f&aacute;lle</i> (butterflies) from his
pocket, he thus addressed her:</p>

<p>'Maiden, rush round the corner and buy me a yard of any thing that will
dry me; I don't care what it is, except salt fish.'</p>

<p>'Oh! but these English are bursting with money,' thought the girl, and
thus thinking, she made great haste, only stopping to tell three or four
friends about the crazy man that was round at her place, who didn't want
salt fish to make him dry.</p>

<p>'Behold me back again!' said the girl, 'I flew.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Van Brick, 'and so did time; and he got ahead of you about
half an hour. Give me the towels.'</p>

<p>'Si, signore, behold them! See how fine they are! What an elegant fringe
on them; and only twenty-five baiocchi a piece, fringe and all
included.'</p>

<p>Van Brick, at last left in peace, plunged into the bath.</p>

<p>When he came out, he found he had half a scudo to pay for the water,
half a scudo for towels, quarter of a scudo for soap, and another
quarter scudo for a <i>buono mano</i> to the bath-girl. Total, one dollar and
a half.</p>

<p>'Now,' soliloquized Van Brick, as he dressed himself, 'I have an
arithmetical question to solve. If a Roman, by hard scratching, can earn
twenty cents a day, and it costs him twenty-five cents for board and
lodging, how long will it be before he saves up a dollar and a half to
take a bath? But that intelligent maiden will tell me, I know.' He asked
her.</p>

<p>'Signore, the Romans never bathe.'</p>

<p>'You mean the Catholic Romans, for the Pagan Romans didn't do any thing
else.'</p>

<p>'They're all burning up in the <i>inferno, Seguro</i>!' said the maiden.</p>

<p>'But they had fifteen aqueducts to keep them cool when they were alive,'
spoke Van Brick.</p>

<p>'<i>Chi lo sa</i>. We have three aqueducts, we Romans, and we have more
water, yes, more water than we can&mdash;drink.'</p>

<p>'Yes, while there's wine about. <i>Adio, bella ninfa!</i>'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GLANCES_FROM_THE_SENATE-GALLERY" id="GLANCES_FROM_THE_SENATE-GALLERY"></a>GLANCES FROM THE SENATE-GALLERY.</h2>

<h3>II.</h3>


<p>We considered, in the last number of <span class="smcap">The Continental</span>, some of
the leading orators and statesmen who, in the last Congress, represented
the States now in rebellion against the Constitution. It can not be
denied that, by their secession from the floor of the Senate, that body,
which undoubtedly exhibits the best specimens of American eloquence, was
deprived of several of its fairest ornaments; but we believe that a
consideration of those Senators who remained faithful to the interests
of their country, will discover the fact that in them was displayed at
least equally conspicuous merit in oratory and legislation. A distinct
contrast was discernible between Northern and Southern eloquence; the
latter being of an impulsive and passionate character, unadorned
generally by the graces which mental culture lends to that art, (which
might be inferred from their well-known temperament,) while the former
appears to be more deliberate and thoughtful, indicating by its elegance
and harmony the refining and systematizing influence of education, and
partaking of the natural phlegm peculiar to inhabitants in colder
regions. While Southern eloquence seemed to endeavor to elicit feeling
and passion, Northern orators looked for their success rather to the
conviction of the understanding than to the indulgence of the weaker
elements of human nature. By pleasing and subtle sophistries, by
enthusiastic ebullitions of resentment and indignation, or by the more
amiable contrivances of patriotic and virtuous sentiment, Benjamin and
Davis sought, if they could not convince legislators, at least to
attract to their peculiar doctrines the impulsive and credulous masses
among their own people. On the contrary, it was apparent that Northern
statesmen, confident in the exercise of intellectual resources, relied
on the intelligence and reason of their auditors and constituents, and
seldom resorted to that species of oratory which was employed by their
adversaries, and which may be called in a manner strategetic, when
logical accuracy was likely to meet with more satisfactory and more
permanent success. Before we proceed to notice the eminent Senators from
the North, we propose to dwell briefly upon several who, though
representing slave States, were, in the last Congress at least, loyal to
the Government; several of whom, however, are now engaged in treason,
while others remain true to their allegiance.</p>

<p>The person who, both from the position he held in the Senate and from
his imposing personal appearance, first attracted the attention of the
visitor, was the Vice-President, Breckinridge, of Kentucky. His later
treachery has made him justly the object of bitter popular odium,
inasmuch as his delinquency was aggravated by his former professions of
loyalty. It was hoped by many who had witnessed his early elevation to
the highest dignities, his undoubted ability both as an orator and as an
administrative officer, and his apparently manly and ingenuous bearing,
that talents which promised to be of so great service to his country
would, in the approaching struggle, be exerted in behalf of its entirety
and honor. Southern 'chivalry' in him was exhibited in a nobler and more
amiable light than in his more petulant and less generous colleagues. A
certain graceful dignity was united with the most attractive felicity of
manner, and one could not help regarding him, when viewed in private
society, as a perfect model of a gentleman. His courtesy and delicacy
were exhibited to all alike, and strangers could not help admiring one
who had at so early an age been raised to so giddy a hight, and yet who
had retained such condescension of manner and such continual good-nature
to every body who approached him. His personal appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>ance, as we have
already said, was highly imposing; in which was combined a manliness of
demeanor and a strikingly handsome countenance and figure. His peculiar
fitness as a presiding officer made him popular in that capacity.
Seldom, indeed, has a Vice-President occupied the chair with such
perfect ease and such stately dignity. His oratory was worthy of a
Senator, elevated, earnest, and partaking less of passion and rancor
than other Southern speakers; but it rather lacked the substance and
solidity which a maturer stage of life would undoubtedly have given to
it. He seemed to be a fair representative of the Kentucky aristocracy,
possessing a delicate sense of honor, a bold spirit, though hardly
enthusiasm of soul. Evidently absorbed in a selfish ambition for power,
this fault is in some degree palliated by the circumstance of the early
age at which he was promoted to the public counsels. That this passion,
unduly encouraged, has led him into a deplorable and fatal mistake, is
now evident; and from what we have recently heard of him, we doubt not
that a similar conviction has made him wretched and desperate.</p>

<p>The father of the Senate, Mr. Crittenden, so well known during the last
weeks of his term as the would-be pacificator, by compromise, of the
impending rupture, was the last of the generation of statesmen of whom
Webster and Clay were the leading cotemporaries. His long service in the
national legislature procured him on all occasions a respectful and
attentive hearing, and were it not for this circumstance, the earnest
impressiveness of his declamation, at times relieved by sparks of
old-fashioned wit, would have attracted the notice of his auditors. He
was singular in his personal appearance, and a peculiarly fierce
expression of face frequently gave an erroneous idea of his character,
which was, making allowance for age and a life of turmoil, affable and
good-natured. He always reminded us of the portraits of Lord Chancellor
Thurlow, whose bushy eyebrows and stern countenance used to terrify
young barristers in Westminster eighty years ago. Rather negligent in
his dress, and far from elegant in manner, he would hardly be noticed at
first as one of the leading members of the body. As a lawyer, he has
been acute and learned; as a statesman, generally able, though hardly
profound; as an orator, not graceful, but forcible and earnest. His
patriotism was, no doubt, zealous and entirely disinterested; but
certainly ill-directed, and not adapted in the application it made of
principles to the exigencies of the times. Representing the most
respected and most prosperous of slave States, and being considered in a
manner as the statesman upon whose shoulders had fallen the mantle of
the illustrious Clay, his influence was considerable, both with
adherents and antagonists.</p>

<p>With sincere satisfaction, we turn to contemplate the character of a
true-hearted and undaunted Southern patriot, Andrew Johnson, of
Tennessee. Coming as he did from a section in which secessionism
predominates, and representing a mercurial and sensitive people, he
stood out fearlessly and zealously in behalf of the maintenance of the
Union at all hazards. He is an admirable example of the self-made man,
having received no education in his youth, and owing to the application
of maturer years the historical and political information he now
possesses. Born and bred among the lower classes of society, and
engaging in an occupation suited to his humble sphere, by perseverance
and patience and a very superior natural ability, he has won a deserved
place in the United States Senate. He is universally considered as one
of the leading intellects in that body, and by his speeches during the
last Congress, in which his enthusiasm as a patriot lent brilliancy and
energy to his naturally forcible declamation, he attracted to himself
the confidence and affection both of his auditors and of the country.
His personal appearance is rather ordinary, not at all imposing, and yet
his countenance indicates a sound judgment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> a pure heart. His whole
manner is open and frank, his bearing that of a gentleman by nature, and
socially he is universally liked. His oratory is also of an ingenuous
character, calculated to impress one at once with his thorough honesty
and humanity. Sometimes he rose to admirable passages of virtuous
indignation and scathing rebuke, as he warmed with the subject of
Southern delusion, actuated by unprincipled leaders, and few of the
Senators who sat on the Democratic side escaped from his truly
formidable denunciation. Lane, of Oregon, a compound of conceit,
ridiculous ignorance, and servility to Southern masters, was totally
annihilated by the sturdy Tennesseean, for his imbecile attempts to
excuse his pusillanimous submission to his chivalrous dictators. So
successful was he in conjecturing and exposing the designs of the
malcontent Senators, that the boldest of them feared to meet him in
forensic discussion, and recoiled from the honesty and acuteness of one
who knew them and did not hesitate to hold them up to ignominy. Through
all the dangers which have beset the neighborhood from which he came, he
has stood firm in the assertion of patriotic principles; nor to save his
own household from disaster, has he yielded a jot to the demands of
traitor tyrants. At present, he is provisional Governor of Tennessee,
and is doing good service in bringing that once-honored State back to
the folds of the Union. Of few public men can we say, what may be
confidently said of him, that he has shown himself ready to sacrifice
every private interest to subserve the interests of his country, and has
given us a certain and practical example of a heroism unknown before the
present crisis to Americans, except in the colored narratives of
history.</p>

<p>Senator Green, of Missouri, was justly regarded as one of the clearest
thinkers and speakers in the Upper House. Irregularity of life had
somewhat blunted what must once have been a very superior mind. His
statesmanship was of a high order; his oratory ingenuous, generally
courteous and conciliatory, and always entertaining, from its lucidness
and keenness. He was decidedly popular in social circles, genial and
good-natured, and full of animal spirits. His excesses, indeed, rather
tended to make him the more companionable, though they undoubtedly
undermined an uncommonly fine intellect; and certainly nothing can be
more sickening than to see one so highly endowed, and who might command
the applause of listening senates, gradually sinking below the level of
manhood by habitual indulgences. In personal appearance, he was rather
awkward, of an ungainly figure, his countenance not highly intelligent,
but cheerful and rather pleasing. After the ostracism of the great
bulwark of Democracy, Douglas, from the councils of his party, Senator
Green became the leader of that side of the house, assuming the place on
the Committee on Territories made vacant by the Illinois statesman. As a
manager of party tactics, and as a bold, shrewd, and energetic leader,
few could equal and none surpass him. His rise to so high a
consideration among his political friends was rapid, but proved, in the
event, well deserved.</p>

<p>We have occupied more space than we had intended, in considering the
Senators from the slave States, and will now attempt to speak of some of
the more prominent Northern statesmen, in this paper, and perhaps
continue their consideration more at length in a future number.</p>

<p>The present Secretary of State was long regarded as the leading
Free-Soil Senator, and after the present Republican party came into
existence, he naturally assumed a prominent position among its
advocates. In caution, in profound foresight, in coolness and affability
of temper, and in perspicuity and logical shrewdness of oratory, he has
been without a superior since the death of Webster. He somewhat
resembles Earl Russell in the prudence and care with which he treats
political questions, and the vigilance with which he notices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> every
symptom of popular tendencies and popular desires. His circumspection is
constant, and the imperturbability of his character enables him to be
ever on his guard, and protects him from the enunciation of an unpopular
idea. Never permitting himself to be annoyed at ever so bitter a taunt,
perfectly self-possessed, and always mindful of the courtesy due to his
colleagues, and the respect due to the most dignified body in the
nation, he has generally succeeded in completely disarming his less
prudent antagonists. In general debate, his coolness and mental balance
enabled him to cope with the most formidable opponents, and although at
times the overwhelming eloquence of Douglas got the better of the more
philosophic orator, such an occurrence was rare, and a triumph was
gained over him only by the greatest exertions of the greatest orators.
His labored speeches, as will be testified to by all who have perused
them, are rich in profound thought, a clear discernment and
comprehension of events, causes, and results, and occasionally in
passages of stately and brilliant eloquence. Graceful rhetoric and
shrewd logic appear to be ever at his command, as he has occasion, in
the course of argument, to resort to one or the other, to illustrate or
to enforce his reasoning. In person, Mr. Seward is of about medium
hight, rather stooping, with reddish-gray hair, an aquiline nose, and
dull, sleepy, blue eyes. His countenance is hardly intellectual, and no
one would suppose, on seeing him for the first time, that he was a man
of conspicuous ability. He is affable to every one, and enters freely
into conversation with all who call upon him; nevertheless, he is
extremely guarded at all times in expressing his opinions, and will
never betray himself into an unguarded sentiment. His manner of speaking
is extremely easy, and occasionally dull; and when in the Senate, he
used to take his position by leaning against the pillar behind his seat,
twirling in one hand his spectacles, while with the other he enforced,
by slight gestures, the more striking passages of his speech. His
delivery was far from animated, and his intonation was rather
conversational than declamatory. He has a quiet dignity at all times,
which is yet consistent with a polite and amiable demeanor; and while
the former inspires the respect, the latter elicits the esteem of all
who approach him.</p>

<p>The present Vice-President was, during the last Congress, Senator from
Maine. He was long known as an able Democratic politician, and in 1856
was elected Governor of Maine by the Republicans, in a hotly-contested
election. He is remarkable rather for a sound judgment and practical
good sense than as an orator or in the higher arts of statesmanship. He
was always listened to with attention, because all looked upon him as
well informed in the everyday duties of the Senate, and as one whose
opinion was formed from accurate observation and a clear head. He is in
no sense an orator, his delivery not being pleasant or his sentiments
couched in graceful or forcible language. He is of a dark complexion,
rather tall, with jet-black hair, a little bald, and would not be
selected as one of the leading men in the Senate from his personal
appearance. As a presiding officer, he ranks well, being apparently
posted on parliamentary law and impartial in his decisions, although he
has not the dignity and grace which lent <i>&eacute;clat</i> to Mr. Breckinridge's
performance of the office.</p>

<p>Senator Fessenden, of Maine, is considered one of the first statesmen
now prominent before the country; and the ability he has exhibited, not
only in the practical details of his position but in the wider range of
comprehensive statesmanship, entitles him to a place superior to most
and equal to any of his contemporaries. Since the retirement of Senator
Hunter from the Finance Committee, (which may be considered as the most
important in the Senate,) Mr. Fessenden has executed the duties of its
chairmanship with an accuracy and vigilance which has elicited the
praise of all sides of the house. His supe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>riority as a financier is
marked; but not more marked than his high capacity for comprehending and
elucidating the great national issues, which swallow up all minor ones
in the magnitude of their importance and the intensity of their
interest. For maturity of judgment, deliberateness of thought and
manner, fearlessness of speech, a presence of mind never lost, and
bitterness of invective, no one ranks above him in the Chamber. His
oratory is of that substantial and yet spirited character which at once
convinces and interests and engages the attention of the mind, without
wearying it by unrelieved exertion. Always the master of every topic on
which he attempts to enlighten, he is neither foiled by the sophistries
nor embarrassed by the bravadoes of his opponents. His eloquence is not
demonstrative, but calm, dignified, and earnest, apparently confident in
the correctness of his views, and yet cautious to avoid giving offense
to others. He is always listened to with the utmost respect, and his
opinions are of much weight among his political friends. His appearance
is dignified and highly intellectual; his forehead being broad and
indicative of great ability, and his general manner being in harmony
with the prominence and responsibility of his office. Never resorting,
in default of argument, to the petty malice of personal abuse, his
course has been liberal, consistent, and uniformly courteous. In private
life, he retains the dignity which appears to be natural to him; but is
yet affable and sociable, attracting one alike by the rich products of
thought and the courtesy of his manner.</p>

<p>Benjamin F. Wade, Senator from Ohio, is a noble specimen of a self-made
statesman. He migrated, at a very early age, from New-England to his
present residence, being entirely without means and devoid of every
thing except his own invincible spirit, with which to secure a
livelihood. The qualities which made him successful sooner than his most
sanguine expectations taught him to hope for, appear in all their
maturity in the character of the Senator. A perseverance the most
constant, a firmness approaching to stubbornness, a courage which never
feared man, and a power of application wonderful in a mind disciplined
only by rude nature, are the component elements which have promoted him
to and maintain him with conspicuous honor in the Senate of the United
States. His honest and intrepid advocacy of principle has won him an
enviable position in his party, and no one possesses the entire
confidence of the country to a greater degree than he. He was
particularly prominent in the last Congress for the bluntness and
severity with which he handled the Southern Senators, and the little
hesitation with which he exposed their delinquencies in the strongest
light. His harangues were full of impulsive, strong, and fearless
invective, and he never stopped to consider the delicacy of chivalrous
sensitiveness, when treason and conspiracy were to be exposed. Probably
no man was more feared by the other side of the Chamber, for he could
neither be cowed by threats nor restrained within the limits of
punctilious courtesy. He dealt with them in the plainest language, and
combined with powerful effect argument, sarcasm, and eloquent
denunciation. Strong sense is a leading feature of his character, and a
practical wisdom which renders him eminently capable in the discharge of
details. In private life, he is genial and always good-natured, ready
for a joke at all times, and enjoys his leisure hours with a zest which
is quickened by previous earnest toil. Although as bitter and
unconciliatory as any of his colleagues in his treatment of the Southern
statesmen on the floor of the Senate, he always manifested the utmost
good temper toward them in social intercourse, and was frequently seen,
after a sharp and irritating episode in debate, laughing and talking
with Green or Benjamin in the most cheerful manner imaginable.</p>

<h2><a name="REWARDING_THE_ARMY" id="REWARDING_THE_ARMY"></a>REWARDING THE ARMY.</h2>


<p>It is a brave thing that we can truly say, after more than a year of
fierce hostilities, the war in which this country is engaged goes on
with undiminished&mdash;nay, with increasing Northern spirit. The enemy has
been obliged to resort to forced conscription, and to declare every man
within its limits a soldier, while we have not as yet had recourse to
drafting; nor, as the late sudden call showed, nearly exhausted our
volunteers. A thousand, and even fifteen hundred dollars have been
offered in Virginia newspapers for a substitute, and yet behind this
there has followed an Executive order for enrolling every man in the
army whether he have purchased a substitute or not. 'Our flag floats
over Nashville and Natchez, over Memphis and New-Orleans, over Norfolk
and Pensacola, over Yorktown and Newbern.' We have girded them in on the
Mississippi, on the Atlantic, and on the Gulf. We know that they are
destitute of almost every thing save mere food and arms, and that every
month sinks them deeper and deeper in destitution and misery. The war is
on their own soil, and their own armies are a scourge and a curse to
their own estates. Every where the plantation and the farm are made
desolate&mdash;every where the direst distress is taking the place of
comfort. And all this they brought on themselves by the most determined
will. They believed that Northern men were all cowards and
half-traitors&mdash;their allies and friends among us promised them easy
victories and certain independence&mdash;they thought that the greed of money
was stronger among us than the sense of dignity and honor&mdash;and now they
are reaping their reward.</p>

<p>Yet despite the bitter need into which they have brought themselves, it
does not seem that those of the South who are in earnest have lost any
of their desperation, or gained a better opinion of their foes. Their
journals still trumpet the loudest lies and the mass still believe that
sooner or later their shattered bark will outride the battle and the
storm, and float safely into the broad sea of independence. Would that
they could see the North as it is, in all its comparative prosperity,
with millions still left to volunteer, and with thousands of foreigners
eagerly seeking for places in the fray. We have found it necessary to
instruct our ministers and consuls abroad that we can not accept for the
present any more of the many military officers of different nations who
desire to fight for the stars and stripes. We have money in abundance,
and there is no flinching at taxation&mdash;indeed, the great source of
apprehension at present is an excess of 'flush times' such as is too apt
to bring on a reaction. When the war broke out we had, indeed, divided
counsels. The old Southern Democrats whined and yelped, and attempted
'peace-parties' and the like; but they have vanished, and traitors now
confine themselves to less offensive measures, while their ranks have
been woefully thinned. We may have disasters; nay, we can hardly hope to
escape them. But in the present state of the war we may fairly boast of
having the upper-hand. And the Northern tenacity which did not yield
when misfortune lowered around, will not be likely to loose its hold now
that it has learned to measure its might, man for man, with the arrogant
enemy.</p>

<p>Under the wise and judicious policy inaugurated by President Lincoln, we
see Slavery, the great cause of this trouble, in a fair way to disappear
in a manner which can give offence to no one. His 'remuneration
message'&mdash;the shrewdest document which ever emanated from an American
Executive&mdash;shows itself, as events proceed, to be a master-stroke of
genius. The longer the cotton States prolong their resistance, the more
precarious does slave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> property become, and the more inclined are the
men of the tobacco States to sell their human chattels. Already in
Kentucky, Tennessee, Maryland, and Delaware, people are longing to
'realize' something on what bids fair to become altogether intangible
amid the turns and tides of skirmishes and battles. Meanwhile with every
day's delay Emancipation, as a predetermined necessity, gains ground
among the people, and very rapidly indeed in the army. It was the lowest
and most tyrannical form of an aristocracy&mdash;that of slaveholding
planterdom&mdash;which caused and is still causing all this trouble, and it
is beginning to work its way into the minds of the multitude that it is
hardly worth while to risk every thing, and see the real criminals
re&iuml;nstated after all in their privileges and possessions, when the one
can only serve to continue the old sore, while the other might be better
employed in free labor. And better employed, we may add, in rewarding
those noble men whose lives were risked in defense of our liberties.</p>

<p>This consideration brings us to the very important question: How shall
we reward our army, and what should be its future mission in the
reconstruction which every freeman will be called to aid?</p>

<p>There is no use in disguising facts, shirking inevitable issues, or
trying to cheat either destiny or honest labor. We have got this
question of rewarding our soldiers with the property of rebels, before
us, and must meet it squarely. The pro-slavery Democratic press may
oppose it, as they have been doing, with all the malignity which their
treasonable friendship for the South may inspire; but we have an
inevitable road before us over which we <i>must</i> travel, and it would be
well to consider it betimes, that we may tread it fairly and smoothly,
and not be dragged along shrieking, by a pitiless destiny.</p>

<p>There are two good reasons why we should begin to consider betimes, the
expediency of rewarding our army with Southern lands. The one is the
necessity of a future Northern policy; the other the claim of the army
to such reward.</p>

<p>If when this war is concluded, our Government is to have a policy or a
principle, it should manifestly be that of re&iuml;nstating itself in power,
in consolidating that power, and in acting as a powerful unity,
according to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. The
<span class="smcap">Constitution</span>&mdash;bear that word well in mind&mdash;the Constitution
which suffers no State to usurp a single power belonging to the General
Government, and which was expressly framed for the purpose of making all
its freemen the citizens of one great nation. Let the reader consult the
Constitution, study its unmistakable plan of national integrity and of
state subordination, and then reflect whether, according to its spirit,
any and every mere state privilege which may be claimed should not yield
to the paramount claim of <i>the Union</i>?</p>

<p>If this war has demonstrated any thing, it has been, firstly, the fact
that the South <span class="smcap">shall</span> stay in the Union, and secondly, the folly
of permitting the old Southern system to control us in politics, in
social life, and in every thing. We have had enough of it. Manufactures,
free labor, science, schools, the press, learning, new ideas, social
reforms, the whole <i>progress</i> of the age, inspiring twenty millions, can
no longer be cuffed and scouted in the Senate and snubbed in the <i>salon</i>
or public meeting by the private interests of half a million of the most
illiberal and ignorant conservatives in existence. Henceforth the North
must <i>rule</i>. 'Must' is a hard nut, but Southern teeth must crack it,
whether they will or no. We may shuffle and quibble, but to this it must
come. Every day of the war renders it more certain. The farm must
encroach on the plantation, the rural nobility give place to the higher
nobility of intelligence; social culture based on mudsills must make way
for the mudsills themselves&mdash;for lo! the sills which they buried are not
dead timber, neither do they sleep or rot&mdash;they were fresh saplings,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> with the reviving breath of spring and at the gleam of the sun of
freedom, they will shoot up into brave, strong life.</p>

<p>Let them talk, dispute, hem and haw, that will&mdash;we can not set aside the
great fact that in future our Government will be united in its policy,
great in its strength, and no longer impeded by the selfish arrogance of
a petty planterdom. Labor and capital are bursting their bonds&mdash;the
Middle Class of North-America which Southerners and Englishmen equally
revile, is becoming all-powerful and seeks to substitute business
common-sense for the aristocratic policy which has hitherto guided us.
It is no longer a question of radicalism, of poor against rich, of
lazzaroni and royalists, but of a new element&mdash;that of labor and of
intellect combined&mdash;the guiding-spirit of the North. And the question
is, how to best aid this element in its progress?</p>

<p>The army of the United States at the present day contains within itself
the best part of such free labor and intellect as is needed to reform
the South. That dashing and daring energy which gladly enters on new
fields, and loves bold enterprises, has streamed by scores of thousands
from the farm and factory toward the camp and the battle-field. There it
is doing brave service for God and for freedom. Every day sees martyrs
for the holy cause drawn from the ranks of these good and noble
volunteers. They die noble&mdash;ay, holy deaths, and as they die new
aspirants for honor step forward to fill their places. When the war
shall be over, it is to the army that we should look to revive the
wasted South, to farm its exhausted plantations and employ its blacks.
Is there no significance in the numerous anecdotes which reach us of
Northern intellect already displaying itself in a thousand forms of
restless activity? The newspaper before us states that General Shepley,
in New-Orleans, has threatened that if the bakers of his conquered city
do not supply bread more cheaply he will remodel their whole business
and employ bakers from the army. 'Bakers from the army!' Ay, smiths,
engineers, editors, and every thing else are there, amply capable of
re&ouml;rganizing the whole South&mdash;of tilling its fields to greater
advantage, of developing its neglected resources, of making the old,
desolate, lazy, dissolute Southland hum with enterprise. Let them do it.</p>

<p><i>We</i> may as well do it betimes with a good grace, for it is very
doubtful if those who venture to oppose the settlement of our soldiers
in the South, will not stir up such a storm of trouble as this country
never saw. An army of half a million after a year or two years of
battle-life, will not calmly return to its wonted avocations,
notwithstanding all that has been said to that effect. A warrant for
Western lands, which will possibly bring a hundred dollars, will seem
but a small matter to men who have seen unlimited paths to competence in
the rich fields of the South. They will not comprehend why the enemy
should be allowed to retain his possessions while they themselves have
been thrown out of employment. There is to be some end to this
protecting the rights and property of rebels. And it is very certain
that a vast number of those who were non-combatants will perfectly agree
with them.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to see the process of reconstruction going on so well in
New-Orleans under the bayonets of our troops. But neither in New-Orleans
nor elsewhere has it any vitality save under Northern direction, aided
by Northern industry. The hatred of the South for the old Union is
insane, terrible, and ineradicable. The real secessionists will never
come back, they will never be conciliated. They will oppose Union,
oppose free labor, hinder our every effort to benefit them, and be our
deadly foes to the last. We might as well abandon now and forever any
hope of reconstruction to be founded on reformed secessionists. A large
party there is&mdash;and it will, if properly protected, become much
larger&mdash;who will join the Union for the sake of preserving their
property. <i>But this party will not be increased a sin</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><i>gle man by our
neglecting to punish those who have been active rebels</i>, while on the
other hand it will dwindle to nothing if left exposed to temptation and
enmity. We must proceed with the utmost energy, and our only hope is in
a complete re&ouml;rganization of the South, by infusing into it Northern
blood, life, ideas, education, and industry. And the only effective
means of doing this will be to settle our army in the South. The task
before us is a tremendous one, but so is the war, and we must not flinch
from it.</p>

<p>We have come to an era of great ideas and great deeds, such as rarely
overtake nations in history, and which when they do, either crush them
to the dust or elevate them to the topmost pinnacle of glory. Petty
expediency, timid measures, small politics, will no longer help this
country. There is a great cause of evil in America&mdash;slavery&mdash;which is
destined to disappear, and which <i>will</i> disappear whether we legislate
for or against it. It <i>is</i> disappearing now under the influences of the
war. Beyond it lies the equally great evil of Southern hatred, inertia,
laziness, ignorance, and depravity. We must learn to live in the great
ideas of making all this disappear before superior intelligence,
industry, and humanity. The great principles of free labor, scientific
reforms and culture, the enlargement of capital, the feeding and
teaching the poor, should become as a deep-seated religion in our
hearts, and we should live and labor to promote this great and holy
faith which is in reality the practical side of Christianity&mdash;that great
shield of the poor. To extend these doctrines over the whole continent
is a noble mission, and one not to be balked or hindered by foolish
scruples or weak pity for a pitiless foe.</p>

<p>He who can raise his mind to the contemplation of the government of
North-America, ruling over a perfectly <i>free</i> continent, may see in the
future such a picture of national greatness as the world never before
realized. <i>Every</i> State attracting the eager labor of millions of
emigrants&mdash;for there will be no cause in future for the foreigner to
carefully shun the slave hive&mdash;the native American directing as ever the
enterprises&mdash;one grand government spreading from ocean to ocean&mdash;the
whole growing every year more and more united through the constant
increase of industrial interests and mutual needs&mdash;this is indeed a
future to look forward to. And it is no idle dream. It will be something
to be an American when we count one hundred millions of <i>united</i>
freemen.</p>

<p>The first step in this advance lies right before us. It will be in
'Northing' the South and in completely sweeping away, by means of free
labor and free schools every trace of the foul old negro-owning
arrogance. And to do this we must begin by finding or making a way to
induce a large portion of the army to remain in the South and reform it.
It is a grand scheme, but we live in the day of great deeds, and should
not flinch from them.</p>

<p>It is, however, tolerably clear to him who looks to the future, that
whether we boldly embrace this scheme or not, it will force itself upon
us or else entail some great disaster. It is more to our interest to
reward the army with Southern land-grants than it is even for theirs to
accept them. The longer we bolster up in its possessions an insolent
enemy, so much the longer shall we have to support an army and pay
taxes. The sooner we weaken the enemy by introducing industrial rivals
into his country, the better it will be for us.</p>

<p>If it be difficult to settle our army all over the South, let there be
at least a vigorous beginning made in Texas, and other States. With
Texas thoroughly colonized from the North and from Europe, sedition
would be under constant check, and its boasted cotton supremacy
completely held in by an unlimited rival supply of free-labor cotton.
Every Southern port should be held and governed as New-Orleans is now
being treated. In due time there would spring up a new generation of
Southrons who would think of us as something else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> than cowardly,
vulgar, stingy serfs, and learn that social merit is conferred not by
being born on this or that piece of 'sacred' dirt, but by full
development and exercise of the talents with which God has gifted us.</p>

<p>But to do all this there must be <i>no flinching</i>. This is not the time to
prate of the 'unrepresented rights' of traitors, or wince at the
prospect of reducing to poverty the men who have labored for years to
reduce us to utter ruin!</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_McDONOGH_THE_MILLIONAIRE" id="JOHN_McDONOGH_THE_MILLIONAIRE"></a>JOHN McDONOGH THE MILLIONAIRE.</h2>


<p>In the year 1850, and for nearly forty years previous, there could be
seen almost every day in the streets of New-Orleans, a very peculiar and
remarkable looking old gentleman. Tall and straight as a pillar, with
stern, determined features, lit up by eyes of uncommon, almost unnatural
brilliancy, with his hair combed back and gathered in a sort of queue,
and dressed in the fashion of half a century ago, to wit, an old blue
coat, with high collar, well-brushed and patched but somewhat 'seedy'
pantaloons, of like date and texture, hat somewhat more modern, but
bearing unmistakable proof of long service and exposure to sun and rain;
old round-toed shoes, the top-leathers of which had survived more soles
than the wearer had outlived <i>souls</i> of his early friends and
companions; a scant white vest, ruffled shirt, and voluminous white
cravat, completed the costume of this singular gentleman, who, with his
ancient blue silk umbrella under his arm, and his fierce eye fixed on
some imaginary goal ahead, made his way through the struggling crowds
which poured along the streets of New-Orleans.</p>

<p>The last time this strange and spectral figure was seen making its
accustomed rounds was on the twenty-sixth of October, 1850. On that day,
a very remarkable event occurred, which attracted the notice of
passers-by and was even snatched up as an item by the ever-vigilant
reporters of the daily press; this consisted simply in a notable
variation from the routine and habits of the old gentleman in the
long-tailed blue. He was seen to stop on Canal street, to hesitate for a
few moments, and then deliberately enter an omnibus bound for the lower
part of the city. Such an occurrence created quite a sensation among
street-corner gossippers. There must really be some new and pressing
emergency, which could produce this departure from the custom and
invariable habits of forty years; so said every one who knew the old
gentleman. The omnibus stopped at the court-house; the subject of these
observations and his blue umbrella emerged from it, and both soon
disappeared in the corridor leading to the so-called halls of justice.</p>

<p>That was the last that was ever seen of the strange old gentleman on the
streets of New-Orleans. The evening journals of the next day contained
the following obituary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Died this morning, the twenty-seventh of October, 1850, at
McDonoghville, opposite the city of New-Orleans, after a short
illness, John McDonogh, a native of Baltimore, but for forty years
a resident of Louisiana.'</p></div>

<p>And the strange old man, who could not ride a few squares in the omnibus
without attracting the attention of every body and exciting public
curiosity to such a degree, was the millionaire, the Cr&oelig;sus of the
South, the largest land-owner in the United States. He had reached the
advanced age of seventy, and his remarkable vigor and health had never
given way under the pressure of the severest and most incessant labor.
Generation upon generation had lapsed into the grave under his eye. A
few, a very few shriveled old men were known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> to him as cotemporaries.
Suddenly, while pursuing so eagerly his imaginary goal, he was seized
with faintness on the street. Other men would have taken a cab, and
ridden home, or at least to a physician's; but when did John McDonogh
turn aside from business to relieve any weakness or want? He had an
important document to file in court. It must be done that day. He is too
weak to walk. There is the omnibus; the fare is only a dime; but that
dime is so much taken from the poor, for John McDonogh is only an agent
for the poor, so appointed and called of God. Such were the reflections
that passed through his mind before he could be induced to perpetrate
this serious violation of the settled rules of a life, this single blot
and stain on a career of unbroken self-abnegation. With a sigh, he took
his seat in the omnibus.</p>

<p>It was his last ride.</p>

<p>In a cold, desolate, dreary, brick building, constituting almost the
only visible sign of the existence of the town of McDonoghville, situate
on the right bank of the Mississippi, opposite to the centre of
New-Orleans, and in a large room, the furniture of which was
old-fashioned, worn, and time-stained, there lay on a small hard
mattress the gaunt figure of the millionaire, tortured with pain and
fast sinking under the ravages of that terrible disease, the Asiatic
cholera. The only beings near were negroes; no white persons were ever
allowed to spend the night under that roof. Those negroes were the rich
man's slaves in law, but companions and friends in fact. His immense
business, his vast estates were administered through them. Even his
documents were copied by them. They were true to him in his moment of
distress and sickness. All that their limited knowledge of medicine
could suggest was done for his relief. At last, in disregard of his
command, a physician was brought from the city, who pronounced his
condition a very critical one. The doctor's first demand was for brandy.</p>

<p>'Massa, there an't bin no brandy in this house for twenty years,' was
the reply of an old, gray-headed domestic.</p>

<p>A servant was dispatched to the nearest grocery; but it proved to be too
late. The dying man perceived his condition, and requested that his
lawyer should be sent for. In an hour that gentleman arrived. He was
just in time.</p>

<p>'Roselins,' he said, addressing one of the most eminent of the lawyers
of the New-Orleans bar, as he held his hand, 'You see I am going; you
see I am not afraid to die. Take care of the estate; 'tis not mine,'tis
God's and the poor's.' And thus, without a struggle, the soul of John
McDonogh passed to its Maker.</p>

<p>His death was truly a desolate one. No devoted relatives or friends
gathered around his couch to cheer his last moments with those tender
tokens of love and sorrow which so sweeten the otherwise bitter cup of
death. No soft hand of woman smoothed his pillow or relieved the agony
of pain and suffering by the timely opiate or emollient. No weeping
little ones were there to cheer his heart with the assurance that on
their dear pledges of affection his name and virtues will live after
him. His lawyer, physician, and his servants were the only witnesses to
the mortal agony of one who could have commanded troops of devoted
friends, and who possessed the qualities which might have adorned the
domestic and social circle.</p>

<p>So departed this life the rich and eccentric possessor of acres
sufficient to have made a duchy or a kingdom, and of money adequate to
the maintenance of the dignity and power of such a position.</p>

<p>But if his death and funeral were attended by so few witnesses, an
occasion quickly followed which was honored by the presence of a large,
eager, curious crowd. It was when his will was probated and read in
court. Intense was the curiosity of the public to know what disposition
the eccentric old man had made of his enormous property. This feeling
was soon gratified. The will was produced. It was a curious docu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>ment,
written on stout foolscap by the testator himself, in a remarkably neat,
clear hand, with the lines as close as type, and his autograph signed to
every page. Being an holographic will, under the law of Louisiana it
required no witness. Ever since 1838, this will had lain among certain
old papers of the deceased; and yet, during all this time, it had been
'the thought by day and dream by night' of the devoted old millionaire.
In its preparation, he had consulted the most eminent lawyers and
studied the most approved law-books bearing on his grand scheme. Truly,
a curious, bold, and gigantic scheme it was. But let us to the will. In
a slow, solemn and impressive tone, the judge proceeded to read to an
eager and interested multitude this remarkable testament.</p>

<p>After setting forth, in the usual form, his nativity, his present
residence, his belief in God and in the uncertainty of life, and that he
has no heirs living in the ascending or descending line, and directing
an inventory of his property to be taken immediately after his death, he
proceeds to bequeath to the children of his sister, a widow lady in
Baltimore, a ten-acre lot in Baltimore, the usufruct to remain in the
widow, with six thousand dollars in cash. He then emancipates his old
servants, ten in number, whom he designates. The rest of his slaves he
provides shall be sent to Liberia. Certain of them are to be sent after
serving those who shall succeed to his estate for fifteen years. The
slaves to be sent to Liberia are to be supplied with plows, hoes,
spades, axes, clothing, garden-seeds, etc.; also with letters of
recommendation to the colonists, and with a copy for each of the volume
of the Holy Gospel of the Old and New Testament, as the most precious of
all the gifts we have it in our power to give or they to receive. The
will then proceeds to provide:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'And for the more general diffusion of knowledge and consequent
well-being of mankind, convinced as I am that I can make no
disposition of those worldly goods which the Most High has been
pleased so bountifully to place under my stewardship, that will be
so pleasing to him as that by means of which the poor will be
instructed in wisdom and led into the path of virtue and holiness.'</p></div>

<p>He gives all the residue of his estate to the corporations of
New-Orleans and Baltimore, in equal proportions of one half to each, for
the several intents and purposes set forth, and especially for the
establishment of Free Schools for all classes and castes of color,
wherein they shall all be instructed in the knowledge of the Lord and in
reading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography, etc., provided that
the Bible shall be used as one of the class-books, and singing taught as
an art.</p>

<p>And now comes the ingenious scheme which had engaged the constant
thought and study of the testator for forty years, by which the grand
passion of his soul for accumulation might survive the dissolution of
his mortal frame and still direct and control the acquisitions of his
life. Of his real estate, no part is ever to be sold; but it is all to
be let out on leases, never to exceed twenty-five years, to be improved
by the tenants or lessees. At the expiration of those leases, the
property is to revert, free of cost, to his estate, to be thereafter
rented out by the month or year. All his personal property is to be sold
and converted into real estate, the aggregate of which is styled his
general estate, which is 'to constitute' a permanent fund on interest,
as it were, namely, a real estate, affording rents, no part of which
fund (of the principal) shall ever be touched, divided, sold, or
alienated, but shall forever remain together as one 'estate.'</p>

<p>The net amount of rents to be divided equally between the two cities, to
be applied as follows:</p>

<p>1. An annuity for forty years of one eighth part, or twelve and a half
per cent of the net yearly revenue of rents of the whole of the estate,
to the American Colonization Society, provided the sum does not exceed
twenty-five thousand dollars a year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>2. For an asylum for the poor of both sexes, of all ages and castes of
color, where they may be sheltered, clothed, fed, and taken care of,
made useful according to their respective degrees of health, strength,
and capacity, and mendicity thereby be banished from the streets of the
cities, he gives one eighth, or twelve and a half per cent of the net
revenue of rents, until the sum shall reach six hundred thousand
dollars, when it shall cease. This legacy is to be received by
commissioners appointed by the corporations, who, as they receive, shall
invest the amount in bank stocks or other good securities, on landed
estate on interest, so as to augment the amount thereof by the
accumulation of interest to the largest possible amount up to the time
when the last of the annuity shall be received, when the commissioners
shall proceed to take such part of said sum, not to exceed one third of
the whole of principal and interest, and invest in the purchase of real
estate and buildings, furniture, etc., essential for the asylum; the
residue to be invested in real estate, which is never to be sold, but
always rented out for the support of the asylum. The locality and
character of the buildings are particularly described. It is recommended
that the persons who shall reside in this asylum be employed in the
cultivation of the mulberry-trees, (this was during the <i>morus
multicaulis</i> mania.)</p>

<p>3. For the Orphan Boys' Asylum in New-Orleans&mdash;an existing
institution&mdash;one eighth, or twelve and a half per cent of the net yearly
revenue of rents. This annuity is to be set aside and deposited in some
bank-paying interest, until it reaches four hundred thousand dollars,
when it shall cease. This fund as it accumulates is to be invested in
real estate, which is never to be sold, but rented out, and the rents
devoted to the charity.</p>

<p>4. For a School-Farm in the city of Baltimore, on an extensive scale,
for the destitute and the poorest of the poor of the city of Baltimore,
Maryland; secondly, of every town and village of said State; and
thirdly, of all the great maritime cities of the United States, of all
classes and castes of color, from four years to sixteen, where they
shall be sheltered, lodged, clothed, fed, instructed in the Christian
religion, and a plain education given them, and taught husbandry
practically, as well as the science of agriculture, providing that the
Bible shall be read and singing taught, especially 'divine psalmody,'
one eighth part, or twelve and a half per cent of the whole revenue of
the general estate, to be paid until it shall amount to three millions
of dollars, when it shall cease. This sum, too, as it accrues, is to be
invested in real estate, until the whole amount of three millions is
received. One sixth of the rents from this investment is to be applied
to the purchase of the School-Farm, the other five sixths to be invested
in lots in Baltimore, which shall be leased out and the rents applied to
the support of the farm.</p>

<p>The modes in which these various institutions are to be governed and
directed are then set forth in tedious detail, interlarded with many
rather trite and moralizing reflections on the importance of having the
young reared up in habits of virtue and industry. A complex system of
government is arranged, and great care taken that the funds thus
bequeathed to charitable institutions shall never be controlled by the
corporations of the two cities. It is also provided, that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'No compromise shall ever take place between the Mayor, Aldermen,
and inhabitants of the city of Baltimore, in Maryland, and the
Mayor, Aldermen, and inhabitants of the city of New-Orleans, nor
shall any agreements be made between these two cities contrary to
the directions of the will. If such compromise or agreement be
made, these legacies shall be void, and the States of Maryland and
Louisiana shall receive the general estate half and half, for the
purpose of educating the poor of said States, and in case of any
lapse of the legacies to the cities, the States shall inherit the
general estate.'</p></div>

<p>After these dispositions and directions, the testator proceeds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Now, with the view of setting forth and explaining more fully and
particularly (if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> it is possible) my desires and intentions as
expressed in the foregoing dispositions of this my last will and
testament, in relation to my general estate, I will add, that the
first, principal, and chief object I have at heart, (the object
which has actuated and filled my soul from early boyhood with a
desire to acquire fortune,) is the education of the poor (without
the cost of a cent to them) in the cities of New-Orleans and
Baltimore, and their respective suburbs, in such a manner that
every poor child and youth of every color in those places may
receive a common English education, (<i>based, however, be it
particularly understood, on a moral and religious one</i>, that is,
the pupils shall on particular days he instructed in morality and
religion, and school shall be opened and closed daily with prayer.)
And in time, when the general estate will yield the necessary
funds, (for in time its revenue will be very large,) over and above
what will be necessary to the education of the poor of those two
cities and their respective suburbs, it is my desire and request
that the blessings of education may be extended to the poor
throughout every town, village, and hamlet in the respective States
of Louisiana and Maryland, and was it possible, through the whole
of the United States of America.'</p></div>

<p>After paying off all the annuities, which the testator thinks will be
completed in forty years, the net annual revenue of rents of the general
estate is to be equally divided, one half to each, between the said two
cities of Baltimore and New-Orleans, for the purpose of educating the
poor.</p>

<p>The testator then proceeds to inculcate a better feeling between the
poor, and rich, declaring that the latter are 'reservoirs in which the
Most High makes to flow the rich streams of his beneficence, to be laid
up and husbanded for his all-wise and all-seeing purposes, and for
seasons of distress and affliction to the poor. Instead, then, of
looking on them as their greatest enemies, they should, on the contrary,
consider them as they really are, their best friends. This is the
position of all rich men, whose hearts occupy the right place in their
bosoms, stand toward the poor.'</p>

<p>Then follows a remarkable and consoling confession of the superior
happiness of the poor man:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Besides, let the poorer classes of the world be consoled, assured
that the labor-loving, frugal, industrious, and virtuous among them
possess joys and happiness in this life which the rich know not and
can not appreciate; so well convinced am I (after a long life and
intercourse with my fellow-men of all classes) of the truth 'that
the happiness of this life is altogether on the side of the
virtuous and industrious poor,' that had I children, (which I have
not,)' [how lively and sagacious the apprehension of the old
millionaire lest some putative offspring might come forward to
disturb his darling bequests!] 'and a fortune to leave behind me at
death, I would bequeath, after a virtuous education, (to effect
which nothing should be spared,) a very small amount to each,
merely sufficient to excite them to habits of industry and
frugality, and no more. As the poor man's friend, then, I recommend
to him to honor and respect the virtuous rich, and to lay these
observations to their heart and to store them up in their mind. And
to the rich, I would say, (if they own feelings, and worthy of
their regard,) 'Give them an occasional reflection.' Hoping
thereby, that the world may advance in happiness, in virtue, and
holiness.'</p></div>

<p>Lastly, the old man grows tender, sentimental, and poetic, He who for
forty years had never been seen or known to manifest a single emotion of
gentleness, of tender feeling or sentiment, of love of children, of
nature, or any domestic affection, in his last will desires to be held
in loving remembrance by the fresh young souls for whose benefit he
declares he has led his long career of toil, of self-sacrifice, and
devotion, to gain. The association of sweet flowers, sprinkled over a
green grave by the hands of innocent children, with the life and
character of one of the most intense, hard and severe devotees to Mammon
that ever lived, is a strange and incongruous one, but it was a picture
which appears to have been very distinctly sketched on the imagination
of John McBonogh, as will appear from the following clauses in his will:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I request my executors (hereinafter named) to see that my funeral
is plain, made without parade, and with the least possible
expenses. And (I was near forgetting that) I have still one small
request to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> make, one little favor still to ask, and it shall be
the last: It is, that it may be permitted annually to the children
of the free schools (situate the nearest to the place of my
interment) to plant and water a few flowers around my grave. This
little act will have a double tendency: it will open their young
and susceptible hearts to gratitude and love to their divine
Creator for having raised up (as the humble instrument of his
bounty to them) a poor, frail worm of earth like me, and teach them
at the same time, what they are, whither they came, and whence they
must return.'</p></div>

<p>Such was John McDonogh's grand theory of philanthropy, which he had
devoted so many years of sacrifice, study, and labor, to mature and
prepare.</p>

<p>Accompanying the will, and inclosed in the same box, were certain
memoranda of instructions to his executors, who were distinguished
citizens of Baltimore and New-Orleans, including Henry Clay, of
Kentucky, and K. R. Gurley, of Washington City, These directions to his
executors are very minute and specific. Certain observations in this
document are worthy of being copied, as characteristic. His reasons for
preferring to invest in land are thus stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'For the base of a permanent revenue, (to stand through all time,
with, the blessing of the Most High,) I have preferred the earth,
'a part of the solid globe.' One thing is certain, it will not take
wings and fly away, as silver and gold, government and bank-stocks
often do. It is the only thing in this world of ours which
approaches to any thing like permanency; or in which at least there
is less mutation than in things of man's invention. The little
riches of this world, therefore, which the Most High has placed in
my hands, and over which he has been pleased to place and make me
his steward, I have invested therein, that it may yield (its
fruits) an annual revenue to the purpose I have destined it
forever.'</p></div>

<p>He also states his motives, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'My soul has all my life burned with an ardent desire to do
good&mdash;much good, great good&mdash;to my fellow-man, as it was chiefly by
that means, and through that channel, that I could bend, greatly
bend to the honor and glory of my Lord and Master,&mdash;which was my
soul's first, great, chief object and interest.'</p></div>

<p>He says, however, he has much to complain of the world, and gives
instances of its injustice, especially in suits, where his just claims
were ignored because he was rich:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'They said of me: 'He is rich, old, without wife or child; let us
take from him, then, what he has.' Infatuated men! they knew not
that it was an attempt to take from themselves, for I was laboring,
and had labored all my life, not for myself, but for them and their
children. Their attempts, however, made me not to swerve either to
the right hand or to the left, although to see and feel so sorely
their injustice and ingratitude made me often lament the frailty,
the perversity, and sinfulness of our fallen nature. I persevered
in an onward course, determined, as the steward and servant of my
Master, to do them good whether they would have it or not. And I
have so strove, so labored, to the last. The result is in the hands
of Him who fixes and determines all results; he will do therewith
as seemeth good unto himself.'</p></div>

<p>Who was John McDonogh, the maker of the foregoing will, and contriver of
such a grand scheme of charity? The answer to this inquiry will be the
most interesting part of this narrative. John McDonogh was born in
Baltimore, Maryland, in 1779. The only incidents of his youth that are
known are, that he was a clerk in a mercantile store in an inland town
of Maryland; that he was noted then for eccentricities, and for an
excess of imagination, which led to the apprehension that he was not
entirely of sound mind. Still his energy and intelligence secured him
employment and the confidence of his employers. About the year 1800 he
was sent out to New-Orleans by a house in Baltimore, with a letter of
credit and considerable resources. He engaged largely in business, but
soon renounced his agency, and starting on his own account, became a
leading and prosperous merchant. In a few years he accumulated a large
fortune&mdash;say at least three hundred thousand dollars&mdash;then a vast amount
in the colony. He was one of the nabobs of the city. His style of living
and habits conformed to his position and resources. His mansion was one
of the most showy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> and luxurious in the city. He kept his carriages and
horses, his cellar of costly wines, and entertained on a scale of great
extravagance and sumptuousness. He was, in fact, the centre of fashion,
frivolity, sociability, and even of the fashionable dissipations of the
day. His person, which even in extreme old age was remarkable for
dignity, erectness, and courtliness, at the period we write of, was
conspicuous for all the graces of manhood. Indeed, he was styled the
handsomest man in the colony. That such a young man should attract the
favorable notice of ambitious Creole beauties who then composed the only
female society in New-Orleans, of managing mothers, desirous of
providing for their daughters, or of fathers, who, in addition to the
latter motive, might also desire to secure a connection which might
promote their own business prospects, was quite natural. The handsome
American merchant, with his still handsomer fortune, was, therefore,
much courted. Though always gay, gallant, and polite, Mr. McDonogh
proved for some time invulnerable to even the charms of Creole beauty.
At last there were indications that a young Orleanoise of fortune equal
to his own, and of personal charms that were the theme of general praise
and admiration, had captured the obdurate Cr&oelig;sus. This young damsel
was then emerging into sweet sixteen. She was the toast and heiress of
the city. Her name and family were among the oldest in the French and
Spanish colonies. Her father was the venerable Senor Don Pedro
Almonastre, an old official under the Spanish government, who, by
prudent investments, accumulated a large property in the very centre of
New-Orleans. He it was who donated the ground on which the Cathedral of
St. Louis now stands. It is for the rest of his soul that mass is
offered up and the bells are tolled every Sunday afternoon in this
venerable temple.</p>

<p>The daughter and only child of Almonastre&mdash;her maiden name we
forget&mdash;was born in the Colony, of a French Creole mother. She had
attained the age of sixteen about the year 1811. It was then that Mr.
McDonogh's propositions for an alliance were favorably considered, and
all the arrangements were made for the betrothal of the parties.
Suddenly, however, a new actor appeared on the stage, who overturned
this well-arranged scheme. There resided in the city a grim, austere,
and wealthy man, who had served in the French and Spanish armies, who
was noted no less for his ferocity and pride&mdash;which had been displayed
in several sanguinary duels&mdash;than for his wealth. He had an only son, a
handsome, graceful, and fascinating young man, who, at the suggestion of
his father, and perhaps at the prompting of his own heart, stepped
forward to lay his claims at the feet of the lovely heiress of
Almonastre. Fortunately for the cause of humanity, as will appear
hereafter, though unfortunately for the American merchant, the young
Frenchman supplanted him in the regard of the fair Creole.</p>

<p>The alliance of two such wealthy families as the Pontalbas and
Almonastres, was a great event in the city, and it was duly celebrated
by many brilliant festivities, at the close of which the happy couple
departed for Paris, accompanied by the father of the young man.
Purchasing a splendid hotel in the Faubourg St. Germain, the Pontalbas
gave themselves up to all the fashionable dissipations of that gay city.
The younger Pontalba was appointed by Napoleon one of his pages, with
the title of Count. Leaving them to continue their gay life, we return
to New-Orleans.</p>

<p>The day after the marriage of Miss Almonastre to young Pontalba, there
stepped into the office of an old auctioneer on St. Louis street, no
less an individual than the rich and elegant American merchant, John
McDonogh, Esq.</p>

<p>'Sir,' remarked the merchant to the auctioneer, at the same time handing
him a voluminous roll of paper, 'there is the inventory of my furniture,
carriages, horses, liquors, stores, plate, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> all that pertains to my
establishment in Chartres street I desire you to sell them all for cash,
immediately. Accordingly in three days the extensive establishment of
Mr. McDonogh was all converted into money, to the great surprise and
deep regret of his many friends and guests. With the proceeds he
purchased a small, lonely house, on the opposite bank of the river,
where, with scarcely furniture enough to satisfy the most ordinary use
and demands of humble life, he immured himself in perfect seclusion.
From that period until his death&mdash;forty long years&mdash;he ceased to have
any connection or association with the world except in the course of
business. He would neither dispense hospitality himself nor share that
of others. Purchasing all the land around him, he placed himself beyond
the curiosity and annoyance of near neighbors. His negro servants alone
were permitted to reside in his house, and they were the depositories of
the secrets of his household, and acted as his clerks and agents in all
his transactions with the outside world.</p>

<p>Whilst thus socially secluded and morose, Mr. McDonogh continued to
prosecute his acquisition of property with augmented vigor and ardor. It
was about this time his passion for accumulating vast acres of waste and
suburban land began to manifest itself. All his views regarded the
distant future. The present value and productiveness of land were but
little regarded by him. His only recreation and pleasure were in
estimating the value of his swamp and waste land fifty, a hundred, and
even a thousand years to come. This passion at last gained such an
ascendency over him that he seemed to court and luxuriate in waste and
desolation. He would buy cultivated places and allow them to go to ruin.
He would build on his lots in the city miserable shanties and rookeries,
which would taint the neighborhood and enable him to buy out his
neighbors at low rates. One of his favorite plans of operation was to
purchase the back-lands of plantations on the river, the value of which
would be increased enormously by the improvements in front of them. So
he eagerly pounced upon all the lands in the neighborhood of the towns
and villages in the State. One of the most brilliant of his feats in
this sphere was the completion of his lines of circumvallation around
the city of New-Orleans. For many years he pursued this object with the
greatest ardor and intensity. Commencing at the upper end of the city,
he stole gradually around through the swamps, purchasing large belts of
land, until at last, a few years before his death, meeting one of his
old friends in the street, he slapped him on the shoulder, and with his
face full of enthusiasm and joy,&mdash;exclaimed: 'Congratulate me, my
friend; I have achieved the greatest victory of my life. I have drawn my
lines around the city, and now entirely embrace it in my arms&mdash;all for
the glory of God and the good of my race.'</p>

<p>During all this eager pursuit of acres there was never any manifestation
of selfishness or of the ordinary repulsive characteristics of grasping
avarice. It is true, he was exacting, punctual, and opinionated. He
pursued his own course in all matters, but there was no misanthropy or
harshness in his manner or deportment. He rarely gave for charitable or
other purposes, for the reason that he would never sell any property he
acquired, because he said it was not his; that he was only the steward
or agent of God for certain great designs. His agency, however, did not
include a power to sell. Hence he could not be induced by any offer or
consideration to alienate any property he had once acquired. Abstemious
to a fault, withholding himself from all the enjoyments and associations
of the world, he devoted his time to the care of his large estate, to
the suits in which such acquisitions constantly involved him, working
for seventeen hours out of the twenty-four, the greater part of which
labor consisted in writing the necessary documents relating to his
titles, in corresponding with his lawyers and overseers. For the fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
years of his residence in New-Orleans, he never left the State, and
rarely, if ever, passed beyond the limits of the corporation. It was
well known that he was entirely wrapped up in some grand scheme of
charity, the nature of which, however, was only known to a few lawyers,
with whom he consulted in regard to the legality of his proposed
dispositions, though none of them knew the mode and form in which those
dispositions were to be made.</p>

<p>McDonogh's scheme was certainly a grand one. In the execution of it, a
man of his character and mind might well feel and display the
extraordinary zeal and enthusiasm that gave to his appearance, habits,
and conduct the characteristics of a monomaniac. Without ever once
turning aside for pleasure, ambition, curiosity, affection, or enmity,
he steadily pursued his great design, until death released him from the
severe servitude to which he had bound himself. But, save in this entire
self-abnegation and social exclusion, Mr. McDonogh had none of the
habits of the miser. He was not a usurer, a money-lender, or a
speculator. He did not extort his riches from the distresses and
weaknesses of his fellow-men. He acquired by legitimate purchase, by
entries on public lands. He dealt altogether in land. Stocks,
merchandise, and other personal securities were eschewed by him. The
wonder is, how, with a comparatively small revenue, his property not
being productive, and his favorite policy being to render his lands wild
and unsuited for cultivation, he was able to go on every year expanding
the area of his vast possessions. Such enormous accumulations are not
surprising under the operation of compound interest on sums of money
loaned; but when effected by purchases of unproductive lands, they
constitute a puzzle which the most intimate of Mr. McDonogh's friends
have found it difficult to unravel.</p>

<p>So much for the labor and practice of realities of the life of the
millionaire. We must not conclude our sketch without rounding off the
romance of that life which is the starting-point in the strange career
pursued by him for forty years, with such ascetic severity and
undeviating fidelity. What became of the betrothed of the gay and
wealthy young American, from whom he had experienced the shock and
disappointment that threw so much gloom over and produced such a
thorough change in his future life? She had left with her gallant young
husband, in bright hopes of a brilliant future. For some years their
life in Paris was one of gayety, pleasure, and joyfulness. In the course
of a few years, the dissipations of Paris began to pall upon the taste
of the young couple. With unbounded wealth and means of enjoyment, they
grew <i>ennuy&eacute;ed</i>, discontented, and finally contentious. Jealousy, like a
serpent, stole into their household, and involved the mind of the
husband in her snaky embrace. Rumors reached his ear which nourished
this passion, until it exploded in a violent and irreconcilable quarrel.
One of the chief instigators of the young Count, in this quarrel with
his high-spirited wife, was his own father, who, in the retirement of a
chateau near Paris, grew daily more morose and misanthropic. He had
heard that his son had been dishonored, and his rage and bitterness were
unbounded. The son abandoned his wife's hotel, and repaired to his
father's chateau, where the two lived in seclusion and gloom. After they
had been separated for some time, the Countess was either enticed by
lures thrown out by the elder Pontalba, or of her own accord resorted to
the chateau, for the purpose of consulting the Count relative to certain
dispositions of their joint property, or certain arrangements for the
education of their children, of whom there were three. The son was not
at home; but the father, receiving her in the hall, invited her into his
study. In a few moments afterward, the servants in the chateau were
aroused by the report of a pistol, followed by the scream of a woman,
and by another report; then all was silent. Rushing toward the study of
Mr. Pontalba, they forced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> the door open&mdash;it had been locked on the
inside&mdash;and there a terrible spectacle was presented. The Countess lay
on the floor, bathed in blood, which gushed in torrents from a large
wound in her breast, whilst her dress was burning from the nearness of
the shot by which the wound had evidently been inflicted. But a still
ghastlier object lay near. It was the body of the elder Pontalba, her
husband's father, who had blown off the top of his skull with a large
dragoon's pistol, which he still grasped in his hand. Though insensible,
it was discovered that the Countess was not quite dead. A surgeon was
soon obtained, and on examination it was discovered that though her
wound was a terrible one&mdash;three buck-shot and one large bullet having
entered her breast&mdash;yet there was some hope for her. After incredible
suffering and long confinement, she recovered; though to the day of her
death she will feel the effects of the terrible wound, to which was
added the mutilation of her hand, which caught the bullet.</p>

<p>The causes and circumstances of that tragedy were never unveiled to the
world. Nor is there any great desire to penetrate the mystery. The
Countess got well, and continued her fashionable life, appropriating a
large portion of her great rental in New-Orleans to the purchase of
property and the improvement of her elegant hotel in Paris. The
Revolution of 1830 found the Countess a fierce Bourboniste, and produced
such apprehension of confiscation, and danger to her life and liberty,
that she concluded to return to New-Orleans. Here she found that her
property had greatly augmented in value, and after a short sojourn in
her native city, discovering that Louis Philippe's dynasty was an
unproscriptive one, she returned to Paris, where she resided until the
Revolution of 1848 again filled her with alarm for her large
possessions. Beside, she was well known to be a conspicuous Legitimiste
of the party of Henry V. Again she returned to New-Orleans, full of
horror of Red Republicanism and Socialism, and with disgust for the
fickleness of the French.</p>

<p>Directing her attention, with characteristic energy and ardor, to the
improvement of her property which incloses Jackson Square, the principal
public place in New-Orleans, she built some forty elegant houses, and
then assuming the government of the municipality, she succeeded in
inducing the authorities to cut down the old trees on the square, and to
have it laid off in the parterre style. The 'Woodman spare that tree'
sentiment strongly opposed this reform; but it was vain to resist the
Countess. The trees obstructed the view of her fine rows of houses, and
down they must come, and down they did come, very much to the
improvement of the city, and to the full justification of the taste and
good sense of the Countess.</p>

<p>After thus improving her property, and augmenting her resources, the
Countess thought she might trust herself again in Paris, though a
parvenu filled the throne which, in her view, was justly the property of
the elder branch of the Bourbons.</p>

<p>But before she left, an incident occurred which must close this
desultory sketch. It happened one day, while the Countess was in a
notary's office, for the purpose of signing some deeds, that a tall,
grave, and eccentric-looking old gentleman entered, and seeing the
notary engaged, took his seat to wait his turn. After completing her
signature of the deeds, the Countess, raising her eyes from the
parchment, perceived that she was the object of close and keen
observation of the eccentric old gentleman with the very brilliant and
piercing eyes. A single glance served to bring that face and form
distinctly back to her memory. Rushing up to the old gentleman, she
threw her arms around his neck, in an affectionate embrace, exclaiming:</p>

<p>'Oh! Mr. McDonogh, is it you? I have not forgotten you during our long
separation.' And after a pause, her emotions checking her utterance, she
continued: 'We were once betrothed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> it would have been better for both
if we had married. Is it too late to repair that fatal error?'</p>

<p>For the first time for forty years, the old man was deeply affected by a
tender and human feeling. The ancient love was aroused from the deep
recess of his heart, where it had kin dormant and forgotten, and for a
moment triumphed over the passion which had been growing and expanding
for the half of his lifetime, until it had gained the entire mastery of
his soul. Greatly moved by this penitence of his once-loved betrothed,
Mr. McDonogh begged to be permitted to consult his better judgment, and
tearing himself from the bewitchments of the Countess, he repaired
instantly to the office of his lawyer. Walking in with the appearance of
great excitement, he paced the office of the lawyer in an anxious and
excited manner for some time, to the profound astonishment of his
ancient counselor. At last the cause of this emotion was explained,
when, turning to his lawyer, Mr. McDonogh confessed that he was under a
great excitement, produced by meeting his old love, the Countess. 'And
what would you think now, R&mdash;&mdash;, if I were to marry her?'</p>

<p>'I should think,' replied the unsentimental counselor, 'that you had
become crazy.'</p>

<p>'Ah?' replied the millionaire interrogatively, and then pausing
thoughtfully, he continued: 'And you would think right&mdash;you would think
right; so let us to business.'</p>

<p>In choosing a caption for the heterogeneous collection of reflections
that are likely to be the result of the 'present writing,' the
superscriber makes no apology for his title not being also a topic to
any further extent than its consideration in this paragraph. The object
held in view in giving <i>any</i> name to the succeeding lucubrations was
merely to obtain a starting-point; it being conceded that the
commencement of a <i>tas</i> of papers need have no greater influence on
their course than the point of departure of a railroad-train exercises
on its terminus and intermediate stopping-places. To resort then to my
heading or its derivations for any indication of my purpose in what may
follow, would be futile, and I am free to disclaim any premeditate
purpose of governing my pen by either <i>hilariter</i> or <i>celeriter</i>, save
as accident may determine. This, at least, gives hope of variety in the
consequences of my present step; but whether spiciness will also ensue,
will depend entirely on the humor of the writer and the complaisance of
the reader hereof. So with no further introduction, the following
children of my moods are presented for the kind consideration of those
under whose eyes they may fall.<br /><br /></p>


<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Has a man a right to use an old pun in making a new joke</span>?
This was a question which arose in the Quidnuncs coterie the other
evening, after Muggins had sent in the following, for the comic column
of a weekly paper, the editor of which had returned it gratefully but
firmly, on the score of superannuation: 'If Truth lie at the bottom of a
well, why should we be surprised that so many kick the bucket before
they are able to reach it?'</p>

<p>Slight sympathy was expressed for Muggins, but in my opinion that was
owing rather to the depravity evinced in the particular attempt than to
any condemnation of his conduct in making an old joke answer the purpose
of a new one. I confess that I don't see why a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> good pun should be
thrown aside after it has served as the soul of a single sentence. I am
a supporter of the doctrine of Transmigration of Puns. For a true pun
always has a humorous idea behind the verbal quip that is its prominent
characteristic. And though the verbal quip may be 'old as the hills,'
the joke may present a face fresh as that of a young maiden and bear a
meaning merry as her eyes. Thus an adept in this art once renovated two
veritable antiques:</p>

<p>'I tell thee, Binks, that the proposition is incontrovertible; any thing
that is worth doing is worth being <i>well done</i>.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, brother Noggs, what hast thou to say to a beef-steak? Does
not thy rule fail thee there?'</p>

<p>'Truly it doth, Binks; but thou wilt grant me that thine is a <i>rare</i>
exception?'</p>

<p>'That will I, right readily.' And both laughed heartily, and went their
ways.<br /><br /></p>


<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">'Sir, you are treading on my favorite corn</span>,' was the mild
protest of one in a crowd against the act of a neighbor who had
encroached on his pedal extremities, by attempting to violate the
philosophical axiom that two bodies can not occupy the same space
simultaneously. The remark raised a laugh; yet it involved a great
truth. Each of us has at least one pet infirmity, which we nurse as
earnestly, with a view to its becoming chronic, (perhaps unwittingly,)
as we strive earnestly to eradicate other morbid troubles. And the
position is true regarding moral as well as physical invalids. Who has
not often been doubly irritated by the removal of his source of
irritation? Thus Paterfamilias Bloggs, having been 'riled' by the
overcrowding of the omnibus in which he proceeds homeward, makes up his
mind that if Materfamilias B. has not provided fish-balls for supper, he
will 'raise a row.' And he so gloats in expectancy over the imaginary
denunciation that he will inflict on that long-suffering female, that he
is quite disappointed, on entering his basement, to discover at a glance
that a dish of beautifully-browned fish-balls decks the evening table.
So Bloggs' wrath is smothered, and smoulders for the rest of the
evening, finding insufficient vent in boxed ears for the children, and
short, crisp replies to civil questions from the older members of the
family. Thus you see that removing a cause does not always do away with
a consequence.<br /><br /></p>



<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Who ever gave a satisfactory excuse for an inopportune laugh</span>?
Certainly, no child transgressing in this particular ever failed to
receive less than ten-fold its due of punishment therefor, as many grown
persons will join me in testifying. Especially is this true in instances
of church cachinnation. I solemnly aver that I have felt a stronger
tendency to hearty laughter in a church than I ever experienced in a
theatre, and yet I could not and can not give any satisfactory reason
for the inclination. I wanted to laugh for the child's reason,
'Because.'</p>

<p>Not many months since, in a land thousands of miles hence, I was
stretched upon a bed of sickness. In pursuance of the humane duties of
his calling, the minister of the Episcopal Church called upon me, and
after a short conversation, proposed addressing the throne of grace.
This he did in a few eloquent extemporaneous phrases, closing with the
Lord's prayer. Now, from the outset, I felt an uncontrollable
inclination to laugh; but for a time succeeded in restraining it. But
when, in close succession upon the minister's words, there arose from
the next room (separated from us by a thin board partition) a sepulchral
echo in the voice of my room-mate, a grim and swarthy miner, who
probably had not heard the prayer since he repeated it after his mother
at her knee, and from the still potent though long dormant force of
habit, now joined in its utterance, the incongruity of my surroundings
overcame me, and I electrified the worthy priest by bursting into a
guffaw. Looking back on the scene, I can see far more pathos than humor
in it; but at the time, the scene was to me irresistibly ludicrous. And
oh! the paltry excuse that I raked up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> 'Nervousness,' I think. No
matter, I had 'spoiled the whole party and broke up the ball!' 'Tis
always the way.<br /><br /></p>


<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Somebody has said that to be a successful author, it is only
necessary to feel what you write</span>. This I deny, for many reasons
which I might but will not cite, contenting myself with saying that to
write what one feels, though much more gratifying and in a moral sense
far more commendable than to conceal or falsify sentiments, is
dangerous, and has been known to cause a writer to feel not only more
than he wrote or could write, but more than he had any expectation or
desire of feeling in such connection. Thus, whenever under an assumed
but transparent title, I introduce my friend Scroggs into a little
sketch of my production, I never express in that performance my actual
estimate of Scroggs, physically or mentally. Nor in my glowing
description of the incidents of a trip to Catskill Mountain House, do I
confine myself to the expression of what I felt in viewing the many and
varied scenes of rural beauty that presented themselves during the
progress of that undertaking. Do you suppose that I would run the risk
of conveying to Claribella, who was my only companion in that
expedition, that I never was more bored in my life, and that my
conversation was the result of operating with a constantly working
though invisible pump at the well of common-places and platitudes, which
a gentleman accumulates for such emergencies in the course of his social
experience? Heaven preserve my hair, should I venture on such a step.</p>

<p>'But you digress,' some impatient reader suggests.</p>

<p>Digress! That is an impossibility in an article without a topic. But
even if I plead guilty, my impatient critic; did you ever take a walk in
the country, and if so, did you choose those broad roads that lead to
churches and the village stores and the 'Academy,' or did you plunge, by
some little modest path, into the recesses of a grove, careless whither
your steps carried you, so content you were to yield to the enchanting
guidance of accident? And what though, in following your bent, you were
compelled to climb an occasional fence or cross a chance puddle, the
satisfaction of coming suddenly upon some pleasant view, or unexpectedly
entering an apparently previously unexplored nook, more than atoned for
such trifling annoyances. Without digression in some degree, neither
spoken nor written language can be made entertaining to the person
addressed. Who is more discursive than the Autocrat, the Czar of
table-talkers; and whose productions are more charming or wiser? We do
not do our everyday thinking in strictly logical or consistent forms. It
is sufficient to introduce hypotheses, premises, or syllogisms, when
there are ends to be attained by such a course. Impulse is far more
attractive than prim consistency in the character of those we love; and
if this be true as to pet persons, why not in our favorite writings? So
the most charming women I have met would be styled in Spanish <i>las
inconsecuentes</i>. Therefore, when amusement is the aim of writing, let
digression have full swing.<br /><br /></p>


<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">I envy a good talker</span>. There is no class of persons so
generally underrated and vilified, yet this would be a dull world
without them. And the faculty is not to be acquired. Really good talkers
are born, not made. (And some, I hear a skeptic say, are not to be borne
in certain contingencies.) Talk is like a river; it rushes onward, by
expression of ideas, <i>making room for thoughts</i> to follow, and the dull
elf, whose mouth is a mill-dam, finds his fancies and thoughts
accumulate on his brain, till that organ is dull and sodden as is his
facial aspect. Why is it that some can only be fluent from the point of
a pen, while others can only address their fellows effectively by word
of mouth? Of course there are conversational monsters as well as other
violations of nature's creative processes. And the more thought that
talk holds in solution, the more grateful the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> offering. But I have
often listened attentively and pleasurably to an hour's flow from the
lips of a pretty, graceful woman, or an interesting child, just saying
enough myself to prove that sleep had not seized me. And at the
subsidence of the tide, I could not for the life of me recall a single
idea to which verbal embodiment had been given. Perhaps I had been
carried away by the music of tone, or the charming, ever-changing curves
of the opening and closing lips, or the dimples in the cheeks, as they
budded, blossomed, and faded in the light of the now laughing, now
languishing eyes, that never lost their hold of mine, yet never bore
mine down by that most intolerable of all social manifestations&mdash;a
stare.<br /><br /></p>


<p>&mdash;I have a friend, who declares that he has <span class="smcap">lost a smile</span>. Not
one from his sweetheart, for that would be either recoverable or
replaceable with another. The smile he mourns is&mdash;his own. To speak
plainly, he has lost, through neuralgia, the control over the risible
muscles of his face, and they not only refuse to obey him in his desire
and design to beam upon all peaceful comers, but occasionally put in
motion another set of facial strings, which give him a depressed and
lachrymose air when he would fain appear most jubilant. He says he never
till now knew how much of his facial aspect was artificial. His present
condition is only relieved when he is under the control of some powerful
emotion. <i>Then</i> he can laugh as heartily and present the appearance of
so doing as fully as ever. It is only the conventional smile, the bland,
self-possessed smile of society, that is utterly gone from him. I
elicited the confession by entering his room noiselessly one day, and
detecting him in the act of making the gloomiest grimaces at a small
boarding-house mirror on the wall. He was much confused, and at first
denied any such employment; but ultimately admitted that he had been
practicing facial gymnastics for the purpose of simulating the smile he
had lost. Perhaps some of our fashionable dentists may be able to aid
him by a suggestion. They certainly have more smiles at their command
than any class of men that have come under my observation. How singular
that the most ferocious quadrupeds and the blandest of men should evince
their most contrasted characteristics&mdash;fierceness and amenity&mdash;by
showing their teeth.</p>

<p>I sometimes think those are blessed who are endowed with a coarse
organization. Sensitive people are chronic martyrs. Their nerves are so
many toes, that their neighbors and friends are perpetually treading on.
Not only are the pangs of such more acute, but the occasions of injury
are infinitely multiplied by super-susceptibility. Talk of the happy
hours of childhood! Ask nine persons out of ten, who are of susceptible
organization, at what period in life their sufferings were most intense
and unremitting, and if they be gifted with good memories, their reply
will be, 'before adolescence.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For susceptibility of nerve implies
also high mental capability, acute intelligence, vivid imagination, all
of which go to intensify sensation, and thus to aggravate the mischief.
And our sympathy is due to one who by one of those strange
contradictions in human nature finds herself, a highly nervous creature,
the victim of an affection for one of the coarser organizations to which
I have alluded. I say victim, for such attachments seldom result
happily. The effect produced, in the first instance, by the magnetism of
a strong over a weak nature gradually dies away. With it die the
brilliant colors in which the beloved has been invested by the belover,
and life is thenceforward only lit up by the lamps that heaven sets in
the eyes of the little children that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>times cheer the darkness of
these ill-assorted unions.<br /><br /></p>


<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">'Sir we are too poor to be economical.</span>' These were the words
which I once heard a woman use to a rich relative of her husband, who
had followed up his refusal of assistance by allusions to many little
short-comings which he had noted in the domestic details of the family.
The phrase seems to involve a contradiction; but a little consideration
will show even the most superficial thinker that it expresses a truth.
Great is the power of ready money. Ready money can save by wholesale
purchases. Ready money can save by choice of place of purchase. Ready
money can save by choice of proper time for purchase. Ready money can
save by discount obtained under threat of discontinuance of trade; a
threat futile in the mouths of the poor. Ready money can save in
furniture and wearing apparel, by being able to provide the best in
fabric and construction, and therefore the most lasting. But it is
needless to extend the catalogue of ready money's powers. None know them
better than those who seldom are able to obtain their aid.</p>

<h2><a name="SKETCHES_OF_THE_ORIENT" id="SKETCHES_OF_THE_ORIENT"></a>SKETCHES OF THE ORIENT.</h2>


<p>The world is undergoing a wonderful change. Even within the memory of
some twenty-five years, what events have occurred to verify the remark.
Civilization changes all the preconceived perfections of the past, and
introduces new scenes of life; it reforms without injuring, and leaves
us undecided as to the value of the progress made. New customs and new
habits leave man where he was; his nature is still the same, and perhaps
he has only engrafted on a faulty structure what neither embellishes nor
improves, and shows how slow is the progress of the human mind toward
this goal for which it has, since the commencement of time, been bent.</p>

<p>This is peculiarly verified in the 'Orient,' the most ancient of climes
and lands. Through the mist of so many centuries, so many thousands of
years, the 'far East' has followed the 'even tenor of its way' through
revolutions and systems; its usages have been consecrated by time, and
the parent has handed down to his son the usages which were more nearly
allied to the natural state of man than those of the more famed and
progressing 'West.' The animal has had more sway than the intellectual
part of his nature, and what the curious traveler most admires is the
still primitive condition of the latter. Violence there reigns superior
to reason, and if changes be made, the former consults but little the
latter in the measures which it adopts for the prosecution of its plans.
There is seldom any appeal made by the reformer to the understandings of
the people to be reformed; they must blindly adopt the innovations
offered, and this without the means of contrasting what they are thus
compelled to receive at the hand of the bestower with what they forsake.
Tossed in the billows of doubt, they are exposed to the rocks of
misconception, and are too often wrecked through the total absence of
any chart to guide them in their new voyage of life. The transitory step
is always a dangerous one to a people who have not entire confidence in
their leader, for his plans may inspire neither conviction nor approval,
and if they fail, leave his followers exposed to all the fury of storms
without any haven in which to seek a refuge.</p>

<p>Sultan Mahmoud, believing that European civilization was superior to
that of the East, imagined that he adopted it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> when he only assumed its
exterior, the costume of Frankistan. How little did he know of the
defects to which this simplest part of it led. Luckily, he adopted only
the habiliments of the male sex, leaving those of the female unchanged.
The flowing robes, full of ease and comfort; the turban, soft to the
head, and giving it protection from the colds of winter and the heats of
summer; the commodious shoe, which leaves the feet uncrumpled and free
from the results of the tighter and closer ones of the West, were laid
aside for the dress of Europe. The only part of the garb which we use,
that he did not assume and compel his people to accept, was the unseemly
and uncomfortable hat, and this he would also have taken, had religion
not interposed to prevent it. Of all parts of the Christian's costume,
the hat is the most calculated to inspire disgust in the sight of the
native of the Orient, and if ever he adopts it, it is because it is
supposed to cover him with protection against the injustice of his own
rulers, and not from any preference or even choice. It is always an
object of ridicule, and serves to point many a remark of derision and
contempt against the wearer. On the other hand, what is more noble and
dignified than the turban, with its snowy white folds, or its varied
hues of green or red? Just as the external appearance of the colored
man, and the knowledge of his total deprivation of civil abilities
perpetuates the existing prejudice against him, so does the dress of the
Frank clothe him with all that is distasteful and revolting in the eyes
of the native of the East, with his prejudices dating back to the
earlier days of the prophets. To pass over the external appearances of
the reformed Eastern, let us examine the results of the civilization of
Europe with which his costume has clothed him. Tight clothes have
unfitted him for the broad and soft luxury of the sofa, and many persons
resume the flowing robe and full trowsers within doors, so as to be able
to enjoy the comforts which they lost with them. For the same reason,
they must sit at a high table, on a high chair. The sleeve of the tight
coat scarcely permits of being rolled up, so that the man of the East
can return to his primitive use of his fingers in place of the fork, and
for this he rejects the coat for the flowing pelisse, or he goes to his
meal in his shirt-sleeves. It is amusing to see the <i>homme de bureau</i>,
or the humble clerk, endeavoring to sit on his sofa cross-legged, with
his writing paraphernalia before him as formerly, or to examine the
broad chair which he has had to invent, so as to suit himself to his new
transitory state. It may even be doubted whether he has gained any thing
by the change, as a <i>cavalier</i>, for the full trowsers were far more
comfortable than the present tight pantaloons, and any one who has seen
the Bedouin horsemen, with their commodious saddles and flowing robes,
must have given them his entire approbation in point of contrasted
beauty.</p>

<p>As yet the Oriental has made no innovation in his domestic life and
habits, or if any, it is that his ladies wear the slender <i>botine</i> of
the Christian lady in place of the loose slipper of former years. As yet
there is no commingling of the sexes, no excursions by land and sea in
boats or carriages together, in undisturbed and unrestricted familiar
intercourse. The lady of the house has not yet met her husband's friends
at the dinner-table, at the social <i>soir&eacute;e</i>, or in the ball-room. He is
quite willing to go to these, at the house of his Frank friend, but he
has not been convinced of the propriety of the change, and his sovereign
has not carried his reforms into harem life. It will require some years
yet to fit the Oriental for witnessing the displays of female beauty at
such places with the calm indifference of the more accustomed native of
Frankistan. He is willing, however, to commingle with the females of his
European neighbors' household, even to embrace them in the mysteries of
the mazy polka or waltz; but he hesitates admitting that such are the
advantages or benefits of civilization. Indeed, it may be doubted
whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> his own wife and daughters would suffer such, were they told
that they might do so without fear of reproach; for it is mostly to the
mothers and wives that the Eastern world owes its tardy progress in the
civilization of the West. Some time since, during the late Carnival,
there was a Persian ambassador present at a ball given by the Italian
minister, attended by the ambassador extraordinary of the Shah of
Persia, who had never been to Europe or in a 'civilized European'
society. Being asked by a foreign gentleman how he was, and how he liked
the ball, he frankly replied, that such an exhibition as that of the
beautiful ladies assembled there <i>decoll&eacute;</i>, etc., had taken him quite by
surprise; that it was more than his nerves could stand, and he felt so
bad that he thought of leaving the ball and retiring to his own
quarters. The same gentleman, to induce him to remain, jocosely told him
that it was the paradise of the Christian, whilst his (that of
Mussulmans) was in the life to come. At this he smiled, and turning
toward a bevy of very handsome young ladies, dressed in the hight of the
fashion, his eyes gloating on the fair scene, answered, that he admired
the Christian paradise very much, and as the other was somewhat
uncertain, he thought he could be satisfied with the persons now around
him. It is quite possible that, except for the loss of dignity which
would have attended the act, the Shah's ambassador might easily have
been induced to join in a polka with one of the infidel houris then
present.</p>

<p>Many of the Mussulmans (Turks) of Stamboul come over the Golden Horn to
Pera, to witness the merry scenes of the Christian Carnival. They do not
select the most fashionable places of resort, and consequently fall into
rather doubtful company. They come sometimes with a companion or two,
but prefer to have only their own people with them, or at most a <i>toady</i>
or two to keep them in countenance. Such a person finds a conspicuous
place, where he can see what is going on, throws off his more than half
European coat, puts on his loose pelisse, calls for his <i>Tchibook</i>, or
pipe, and, it must be added, something very much like hot punch, and
goes in for the full enjoyment of the evening. In an hour or two, he is
rather 'pulverized,' and very disregardful of what he says and does. The
true semi-barbarian then comes to view; he becomes very ostentatious,
and is disposed to act the fast man; a friend will always find him a
lady, whom he invites to accompany him over to his <i>konak</i>, (private
dwelling in Stamboul,) which she refuses; he urges her to play <i>faro</i> or
<i>rouge et noir</i> with <i>his</i> money, which she does, until his purse is
rather light, and by this time our Turk is so far insensible as to
require to be conveyed to his carriage by the toadies or private
attendants above mentioned. This he thinks is all right, and calls it <i>&agrave;
la Franka</i>, or conformably with European civilization and fashion.</p>

<p>The Armenian and Greek ladies, too, are adopting the same ideas of
reform and improvement in social life. One of the former, a fair,
married lady, of good family, having lately fallen in with a young and
handsome foreigner attached to one of the legations, allowed his visits
to become more and more frequent, so that one day her husband, returning
home rather sooner than expected, caught the couple in <i>flagrante
delicto</i>. This was carrying European civilization somewhat to a delicate
point; but she shielded herself against the husband's reproaches by the
assertion that it was <i>&agrave; la Franka</i>, and the matter was compromised
without any 'secession movement.'</p>

<p>The late Sultan built a theatre, and had a corps of ballet-girls for
private amusement. He frequently gave entertainments at the former to
the foreign legations, and one season even attended a <i>bal par&eacute;</i> at the
British Embassy, and a <i>bal en ordinaire</i> at the French. This rather
startled some of his subjects; but as such things were considered <i>&agrave; la
Franka</i>, it passed over without any serious results. At the former, it
is said, an amusing incident occurred,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> which, if not altogether true,
is <i>bon troveto</i>. The late Sultan was extremely sensitive about coming
in close contact with non-believers in the principles of the blessed
Prophet. He never could touch the letter accrediting a foreign
ambassador without hastening to perform ablutions, and as to conforming
to the custom of shaking hands with an infidel, it was too horrible to
be thought of for a moment. All animals, except horses, he held in
abhorrence, and changed his entire costume several times a day, if he
happened to have occasion to expose himself even to the winds blowing
from the direction of the infidel hill on which Pera, the residences of
the Christians, are built. On his arrival at the ball in question, he
was, as is customary, shown into a private apartment, for a moment's
repose previous to entering the salon in which hundreds of gay visitors
were collected. The apartment happened to be that of the lady of the
Ambassador, in fact, her <i>boudoir</i>, in which her poodle-dog, <i>Bijou</i>,
had been accustomed to stay. Scarcely had the Sultan taken a seat,
before poor Bijou made his appearance, and was at once driven away by
some of the frightened attendants; but soon after returning unnoticed,
the spiteful brute approached the Sultan, and offered the greatest
indignity in his power to the pantaloons of the sensitive monarch.
Imagine the indignation which occurred, and the designs of the wily
British Ambassador to civilize the Turkish Sultan would have been wholly
frustrated had not the chief gardien of the Sultan's wardrobe
fortunately brought with him a full fresh suit for his master, in case
of eventualities.</p>

<p>On the same occasion, the British Ambassador, for the same laudable
purpose of civilizing the various clergy of the Ottoman capital, had
insisted upon the Armenian, Greek, and Catholic Armenian Bishops and the
Greek Rabbi of the Jews appearing at his <i>bal par&eacute;</i> in their canonicals!
Against this they strongly remonstrated, but the influence of the
Ambassador was greater than their own, and they had to make their
<i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;t</i> at his ball in full dress. But this was, however, soon
forgotten, as it was all <i>&agrave; la Franka</i>.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the late Sultan, on the occasion of the circumcision of
one or two of his sons, gave a series of entertainments to his own
functionaries, and one to the foreign diplomatic corps, in one of the
valleys on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, called Hyder Pacha. With
the view of properly amusing the foreign legations, <i>&agrave; la Franka</i>, the
Sultan got up an extemporary theatre, adjoining the splendid pavilion,
in which his guests were assembled. The play selected as best calculated
for the purpose, was the <i>Milliner's Shop</i>, the like of which the Sultan
had noticed while passing through the great street of Pera&mdash;the windows
filled with bonnets, dress-caps, crinolines, etc., and very handsome
dolls, some quite as 'large as life,' <i>decoll&eacute;</i>, and thanks to the
miniature crinolines, often showing very well-made chaussures and
ankles. The little stage was not much raised above the green sward of
the valley&mdash;a ditch had been dug out for the use of the orchestra, and
the counter of the milliner separated this from the audience. As the
whole affair had been got up rather hurriedly, the <i>entrepreneur</i> had
not been able to procure a sufficient number of blocks on which to
exhibit the bonnets and caps, and as men were readily obtained for the
purpose, holes were cut in the counter, through which these thrust their
heads, and on them rested the articles in question. A man also figured
against the wall, on whom to hang up a ready-made dress or two, while
his head also served as a block for a first-rate bonnet with flowers and
feathers to suit the occasion. Now the weather had threatened a change,
and much to the regret of the Sultan and his Court, who had it at heart
to give such an entertainment to the diplomatic corps of Europe as would
tell largely in the papers, and prove the great progress made by him in
civilization, just as the play commenced, the rain began to fall in
torrents. In their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> pavilion, the foreign ambassadors, etc., were
somewhat secure, but not so the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. The ditch soon
filled with water, and the orchestra had to hold their instruments above
their heads, while the water rose to their waists, and finally drove
them to open 'secession.' But the man-blocks which supported the
millinery were still more to be pitied. Their heads were fast in the
holes made, and partially closed again in the centre, so that they were
unable to escape from the rain which deluged the whole affair. The water
fell in torrents over the gay bonnets, caps, crinolines, etc., until
they became a mass of tawdry, and the bare pates of those under them
came ludicrously into view. It required the assistance of a carpenter
and his aids to get the poor fellows free from their bondage, and enable
them to seek safety in flight. As to the man fastened against the wall,
he bore his torture, and the merriment which he occasioned among the
audience, for some time, but finally was compelled to put an end to his
part of the entertainment by a timely retreat.</p>

<p>Sultan Mahmoud was the first reformer of the Ottoman Empire, and his
second son, Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz, the last. The reforms of the late
Sultan, Abd-ul-Mejid, nearly ruined him, and the consequence is, that
the present sovereign has wisely concluded to fall back upon some of the
older fashions of his people. Mahmoud thought to drive away the
remembrance of the Dervish-Janissaries whose violences seldom allowed a
Sultan to die of disease, and never of old age. To effect this, he
disbanded their several corps, and created new ones, in another dress.
Perhaps this was wise at the time, but the object once reached, he
might&mdash;or his successor, at most&mdash;have restored the broken spirit of his
people, by a return to their national costume. It was only by force and
fear that he induced his new troops to adopt the dress of the deeply
detested Ghiaours, and the measure greatly alienated the respect and
affections of his subjects, especially those of the interior of the
empire. The higher classes of the capital assumed it with less reserve,
on account of the economy which it admitted, and because it was <i>&agrave; la
mode</i>, but the lower were less disposed to lay that one aside which had
been worn by their ancestors, and served to designate the true
Mussulman. The picturesque costume of the natives of Arabia, of Egypt,
Syria, and Albania, had to be thrown aside for the tight pantaloons and
coat of the Infidel, and Mahmoud went so far even as to require the
<i>Bombardiers</i> of his army to wear a head-dress, black, and tall as a
hat, differing from it by the absence of a rim, and open on the top,
covered only with a bag of dark silk, drawn together with a cord. This,
how-ever, disappeared in the reign of his successor.</p>

<p>The present Sultan has adopted a middle course. Without either restoring
the costumes of the Janissaries, or even assimilating the habiliments of
his troops to that which they wear in their own country, which would
have inspired a strong and useful <i>esprit de corps</i>, he has accepted the
uniform of the Zouave and Turcos of the French army. It is sufficiently
Oriental to meet the object desired, and is very popular in the Sultan's
army. It leaves to the wearer the free use of his limbs, but as a
parade-dress will not show so favorably, to European eyes, as the more
dignified dress of the Guards. The most difficult part of a military
costume is the head-dress; and the common red cap of the Turks, called
the <i>Fez</i>, is even more objectionable than the unseemly slouched hat
worn in the regular army of the United States. Around this cap the
Sultan has had a small turban bound, in one or two folds, which is a
relief to the eye, and easily kept in order. It is readily taken off, in
case of need, and may be bound around the waist as a sash, or girdle.</p>

<p>This change in the dress of his army has given to his people the idea
that their new Sultan is anti-Christian, and will restore the Ottoman
Empire to its former state and condition. How far this will be verified,
still rests to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> seen. Reforms not entirely needed, and but half
carried out, leave the recipients in that transitory state which weakens
and demoralizes without effecting any permanent and real benefit. An
external change is certainly less efficient than a moral one, but it
goes far toward influencing the feelings of patriotism and loyalty which
are so essential to man in his political condition, and it is more than
probable that the anti-reforms of Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz will effect more
real good in his capital, and elsewhere, than the boasted reforms of his
illustrious father.</p>

<p>The creative power of man, though so much boasted, is after all but a
mere phantom&mdash;a vapor which rises from the ground and floats with little
change of form from place to place. The diapason which we thought so
extensive, appears, on inquiry, to consist of only a few notes, and the
changes that may be rung upon them, may almost be counted upon the
fingers. Homer's fables are near of kin to those of Shakspeare; the
legends of ancient Greece find their details mirrored exactly in the
traditions of Spain, Scotland, and Scandinavia. Whether in the remoter
fogs of the past some glimmering traces of light may lead us to discover
a common origin, a universal fountain, whence proceed pure and limpid
all the streams that are contaminated by baser contact in their later
course, is a question which might mightily task the most powerful minds.
The gods of Greece and Rome are reproduced in Odin and Thor, Freia, and
Gerda and Tduna. Aphrodite at Athens, Venus on the Seven Hills, Freia in
the North, differ but in name. Dark hair and coal-black eyes, and a
warm, sunny beauty may please the ardent inhabitants of Greece and Rome;
the Swedes and Germans may bow before golden hair and blue eyes, fair
and blooming cheeks. But transport the Grecian Aphrodite to the
Dofrefield glaciers, and she will soon grow white as their snow, her
eyes will fade to the pale cold blue of their skies, and with the winter
frosts her hair will turn like fall leaves, golden yellow; and under the
sun of Italy, Freia will tan to the burning, dark-hued, voluptuous Venus
of the South. The two soils naturally breed the one cold statues, the
other passionate life, but these two different phases are in themselves
identical, Thor's hammer, and the various wonderful exploits of the
Northern gods and goddesses, their dim, ill-defined notions of creation,
of time and space, and of future worlds, are but natural growths from
the nature of the North. Their gods, like their men, are all action, and
to raise their actions above those of the human race, they naturally
invest them with peculiar supernatural physical endowments, and a
strange, mysterious mode of action. The powers of magic come to their
aid; they are not absolutely omnipotent. Dwarfs forge them invincible
arms in subterranean caverns; earth, air, fire, and water, conspire to
assist them. The elements rage or are appeased at their command.</p>

<p>In the same way the gods of Greece and Rome are all repose. Their
actions acquire a superiority over those of man not by supernatural
agencies or extraordinary developments of physical power; their
pre&euml;minence lies in the quiet assumption of power, in the immediate
sequence of action on volition. Their divinity is esoteric, consisting
in attributes innate and not assumed. Action with them is power; but in
the North power must be superadded.</p>

<p>Thus we find all the various attributes embodied in the gods of the
South, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>wise deified and modified in the North, Thus Loke is the
Mercury of the ancients. He is the same sly rogue as Hermes, though he
has not some of the better qualities of that god. He is essentially the
god of deceit. His deceptions are more subtle and deep-laid than those
of the Grecian adept. He combines with the Pagan element something of
the old Christian Satanic element. Without the horn and hoof of the
Christian devil, he has all his peculiar mental qualities, and uses them
to the great prejudice and harm of the other gods. So, likewise, with
many of the more human &#956;&#965;&#952;&#959;&#953;. We find the same ideas to spring
up in the agora of Athens, the wilds and snows of Norway, and the
heathers and hills of Scotland. The fable of the Sirens finds an exact
counterpart in the North. Like Ulysses, Duke Magnus and innumerable
others escape with difficulty from the charms and enticements of
sea-nymphs. Sometimes it is their wonderful song which the earth and
the elements obey as they did Orpheus, that attracts them. Sometimes it
is by more sensual blandishments, and sometimes by sweet and tender
persuasion, <i>suad&aelig; medull&acirc;</i>. Mountain elves start from the ground, and
from unseen caverns, and attempt to entice brave knights to their ruin;
they dance round them beneath the trees, and endeavor to make them join
in their dances. The natural fortitude of the stalwart champions is
rarely able to resist the temptation, and they are always on the point
of falling, when some unoffending barn-yard fowl sounds the signal for
retreat, or some Christian word is uttered, or sign made, and the fair
visions vanish, either naturally or in divers shapes with odors of
brimstone and sulphur. The differences between the Grecian and the
Northern conceptions are striking. In the Greek the forms are clear and
vivid. The sirens are beautiful women, with angelic voices and vulture's
talons. There are nothing but conceivable realities in their story.
There is nothing strange or supernatural in their accessories. But in
the Scandinavian elves the case is different. They vanish and re&auml;ppear
at different times; they have no actual, permanent existence. The crow
of a cock or the sign of the cross is enough to drive them back to their
hiding-places. They shun daylight and fixed, customary spots. They
generally surprise casual travelers, and upon them in lone, romantic
spots, practice all their arts of enticement and seduction. There is
always something of magic, of the supernatural, connected with them. The
Greek sirens are not like common women; but once conceive of their
physical existence, and you understand them thoroughly. Their laws of
action are purely human, and we do not find them one half so unnatural
as our neighbor that has a splay foot or a hunchback. The Northern
witches, however, are formed like human females, but obey unknown and
mysterious powers. The commonest words and associations of men are bans
to them. Only so long do they have power as nothing human disturbs and
overthrows their supernatural spells.</p>

<p>Again let us look for a moment at another division of Grecian fiction.
The grim Cyclops who toils for Vulcan, working like mortal men, and
forging divine things, it is true, like any Grecian blacksmith, has a
counterpart of a somewhat different character in the North. The reality
and vividness of the Greek changes as we approach the Pole. In deep
caverns distorted, strange little dwarfs work by the aid of supernatural
powers wondrous weapons, swords of incredible qualities, armor that
defies mortal blades, bracelets of wondrous and cunning finish and
singular properties&mdash;all here is miraculous, the workman, the process,
and the work. The vividness with which Homer presents to us the one-eyed
Polyphemus, with his tree-staff and his ponderous body, is exchanged by
the Scandinavian for smallness, indistinctness of form and of power. The
grand in the South is obtained by giving enlarged pictures of man as he
is; in the North, by investing him with strange, magic, mysterious
quali<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>ties. In mental as well as material nature, a general haziness of
outline conveys the idea of greatness as strongly, though in another
manner, as the sharp and perceptible outline of any thing really great.</p>

<p>This peculiarity we shall find running through the literature, the
character, and the mind of the two nations. The North is misty,
undefined, illimited; the Greek is clear as crystal, sharp and angular,
on every side. Its conceptions are never vague, but are tangible, real,
and human. Thus with the Greek, a vast ocean, like that they know,
encircles the whole earth, and fixes its bounds and the limits which man
shall not pass; the Northerns compassed it about with a vast serpent of
immense size, which bounded infinity and space, time and eternity,
thereby mirroring, in some degree, as it were, the ancient symbol for
time and space without end, the snake biting his own tail, the circle
with no one beginning nor end. The heaven of the Greeks is the summit of
one of their own mountains, known to every peasant and inhabitant.
Accessible only to the gods, there they live, as unconcernedly as though
the earth were not. Thor, and Odin, and Freia live in the 'Shining
Walhalla,' whither go the souls of brave and good warriors. Their way
thither is over the heavenly bridge, the many-colored rainbow, thrown
over between heaven and earth for the passage of the happy souls. And
there in this dim, ghostly Walhalla they sit like the Grecian gods, and
drink mead instead of ambrosia and nectar. They do not share in the
earthly vices of the Southern gods. Thor never begat such a progeny as
Jupiter.</p>

<p>Repose is also, as hinted at, a characteristic of Southern mythology,
while action, assisted by supernatural agencies, is the feature of the
Northern deities. Thus Jupiter sits majestic and silent upon Olympus and
nods his head, and the whole earth shakes. He is human in his character,
but of an ideal and superior human nature&mdash;man immensely magnified. The
gods of Norway are also human, but they are, in themselves, <i>mere</i> men.
What makes them gods is the magic power which is joined with them, a
mere adjunct not forming a part of them. They toil and act like
men&mdash;they are never still. Thor bears the hammer, the emblem of physical
strength, energy, and activity. He can at a draught half drain the sea,
and cause the tides to rise and ebb; he can lift the serpent that
surrounds the world; he can wrestle with Death himself, and almost come
off victorious. The giants are his mortal enemies, and against them he
wages war and bears deadly hatred, as Jupiter against the Titans. None
but the warrior, who has fought long and well, enjoys the long dreamt-of
mead of Walhalla. A death on one's own bed is almost as ignominious as
that of the coward. The straw-death (<i>str&ouml;dod</i>) they will endeavor to
avoid by opening their own veins and bleeding to death, and as the warm
life-blood pours forth, they sing triumphant death-songs, and see the
portals gradually open to receive them, and Braga the Scald, seated at
the gate with his magic-sounding harp, his fingers running through the
golden strings, and in such ecstasies they give up the ghost. The Greek
dies in a more quiet, philosophical, and practical manner. He does not
fear the shame of a warm and soft bed. Achilles, and Ajax, and Diomed,
are not the only inmates of Elysium. Socrates, and Plato, and Homer,
Apelles and Zeuxis, are all there too. The poet and the philosopher, the
painter and the sculptor, rank as high through pen, pencil, and chisel,
as the warrior by his blade and his bloody exploits. Art, in the North,
finds no existence, and strikes no sympathizing chord in the bosoms of
the sturdy Northmen. Art, to be perfect, requires a distinctness of
conception, and an assimilation to human nature in its subjects,
entirely at variance with the dim, mysterious character of the
Scandinavian imagination. Painting is a thing utterly unknown, and
sculpture, where found, deals in shapeless blocks and huge, massive,
ill-proportioned forms, analogous to the primitive Egyptian art. In the
Northern mythology and legend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ary history, minstrels play an important
part. They are as indispensable as the Welsh bards, though not invested
with the same authority as they. At the table of the gods, Braga strikes
his wonderful harp and chants the triumphal hymns of dead warriors as
they enter the Walhalla. Round the boards of the rougher Vikings, among
the muscular, sun-browned champions, hardened to blood and strife, the
minstrel is ever present, and as the huge cups pass around the long
line, they sing the triumphs and praises of their hosts. They are like
the old Grecian minstrels; like Phemius and Demodocus, they chant old
memories of great sea-kings and champions, legends of magic elves and
dwarfs, and wondrous and often touchingly beautiful stories of love and
passion. The vague impressions of music seem to harmonize marvelously
with the Northern nature. It is wild and weird in its character, for
much of it, with the innumerable ballads of those days, have reached us
from father to son, and vividly recall the times whence they date, and
the men whose characters they mirror. There is often a magic element
connected with their music. The music of the elves is like that of the
sirens and of Orpheus, often irresistible. Through many of their ballads
runs the same legendary undertone. A maiden's song moves the king's
heart, and one by one he offers in vain every gift in his power, to the
very half of his kingdom, and ends by placing a crown of gold upon her
head, and seating her beside him on his throne as his lawful queen. The
story of the two sisters, one ugly and one beautiful, reappears in the
North in various forms. The younger and more lovely of the two is
murdered, and the elder is to wed her bride-groom. Pilgrims who meet
with the body, make a lyre from the bones, and string it with the golden
hair of the maiden, and as they play at the bridal, each string tells
its tale of horror in turn, while the unhappy sister sinks under these
inanimate accusations.</p>

<p>In the Greek myths we find none of these mysterious elements. The
supernatural creations we meet with are innumerable, and no less strange
in themselves. But there is nothing in Polyphemus, in Circe, in the
Sirens, beyond their physical natures, which can make us look beyond
ourselves to understand and fully sympathize with them. Once fully grasp
their superhuman endowments, and you feel they act like men on a large
scale. Not so with the Northern supernatural beings. In themselves they
approach nearer to men, and are but little above them in endowments and
character, but it is their mode of action which makes them superior to
us; their divinity and power lie not in themselves, but in the agents,
visible and mysterious, that they employ. They are not like Jupiter,
omnipotent. They are brought to a stand quite as often as more humble
mortals. Thor, without his hammer, is no longer Thor himself. His trusty
Mj&ouml;lner is more to him than the thunderbolt of Zeus to the Grecian
father of the gods. The eagle and thunderbolt of Jove, the &aelig;gis of
Minerva, the girdle of Venus and Mercury's wands, are mere emblems of
what powers their own natures give them. With the Northern deities their
whole strength lies in the possession of these. Without them they are
powerless, and in spite of all their might, they are often obliged to
call on one another for assistance, and sometimes even stand in need of
mortal aid. We may, perhaps, consider the Grecian gods as mere
personifications and idealities, but those of the North are essentially
real. They are the creations of a powerful but vague imagination, forms
which resemble a Norwegian mountain, distinct in itself by its
glittering snows and icy rocks, but which shrouds its head in a
perpetual mist, except when some adverse wind with its indiscreet
blowing, displays it in all its nakedness, and plain though grand
reality.</p>

<p>Analogous to the story of Circe and Ulysses is a myth which forms the
foundation of some of the most beautiful and pathetic ballads of Sweden,
Den<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>mark and Norway. The mountain king bears to his cavern in the
hill-side a fair maiden, and with him</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'For eight long years, I ween, she lived in the mountain there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sons full seven she bore him, and eke a daughter fair.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>And here the resemblance ceases, and the Northern legend assumes a more
beautiful tone. The maiden longs for her mother and her old home, and
goes from the mountain king with the promise not to mention her seven
sons. She tells her tale, however, and the elf-king straightway appears,
and strikes her till the life-blood flows. She then says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Farewell, dear father, and farewell, dear mother, too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell, my sister dear, and dear brother, farewell to you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell, thou lofty heaven, and the fresh, green earth, farewell!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now wend I to the mountain where the mountain king doth dwell.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>And so they ride to the mountain, through the long, wild, black wood,
the mother weeping bitter tears, while the elf-king smiles. Her little
daughter reaches her a golden chair:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Oh! rest thee, my poor mother, so sad and woe-begone.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>She takes the foaming mead in her hand,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'And scarce from out the mead-glass bright the first draught does she take,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(The hour goes heavy by,)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her eyes were sudden closed, and her weary heart it brake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(Ah! well sorrow's burden know I.)'</span><br />
</p>

<p>That the Greeks had similar ballads and legends can not be doubted, but
to revive them from their present destruction is a task beyond the power
of science and antiquarianism. Hardly more than a quarter of a century
has elapsed since the first important steps were taken in the North of
Europe to preserve these ballads which had thus been orally handed down
from ages that vanish in the darkness of the past, and which in a few
years more, with the gradual disappearance of primitive simplicity in
Sweden and Norway, might have been, for the greater part, lost to us
forever. Who knows but that in some remote corner of Greece, in spite of
the revolutions and shocks which have convulsed it, there may still lurk
an occasional shadow at least of some good old popular song?</p>

<p>The refrains which accompany the Northern ballads, and which are, in
fact, found among all nations whose ballad poetry has been preserved,
merit some attention. Sometimes melancholy and sad, sometimes gay and
joyous, they impart character wonderfully to the piece. There is
something peculiarly mournful in the recurring of these sad, touching
thoughts and words, and as the interest of the ballad deepens, their
touching simplicity grasps more deeply into the soul, and affects us in
a manner which nothing else could. When they are joyous&mdash;a rarer form,
however&mdash;they impart to us also their own buoyancy and gayety. Sometimes
they convey the moral of the piece, some simple yet profound reflection,
which marks by itself the feeling that pervades the whole ballad; at
other times they are merely descriptive of nature, and borrow their
enlivening or heart-rending character from the assimilation or contrast
they present with the groundwork of the poetry. The origin of this kind
of refrain is evidently due to the manner in which the ballads were
composed. Mainly extemporized, both words and music, by wandering scalds
or minstrels, the refrain was a pause to enable the singer to compose
the next line. The utter disregard of rhyme, alliterations the most
slight and imperceptible, and words of no similarity of sound almost
always taking their place, rendered this a very easy task. A thorough
knowledge and mastery of legendary lore, and a little power and
concentration of thought and imagery, were the only qualities requisite
for a ballad-monger. Some of them bear the marks of superior minds, both
by their wonderful vividness of description and by the tone of deep,
genuine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> feeling which pervades them throughout.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful affinity between the Scotch and the Norwegians and
Swedes, especially in their traditionary literature, which marks a
common origin and common customs at some remote period. We find among
the genuine Scotch ballads many that are almost literal versions of the
same Scandinavian legends no less indigenous in their own land. A large
number of the most beautiful Scotch ballads plainly point to an
extraneous Northern origin, and their exact counterparts in form, ideas,
and words, we find circulating as popular songs among the Swedish,
Danish, and Norwegian peasantry. These may often be traced back
centuries, at the end of which they seem still to be as old and as
thoroughly implanted in their native soil as they now seem. They have
been sung from mouth to mouth, with the same wild old melodies and the
same quaint language, as they were sung centuries ago among the scenes
they so faithfully depict.</p>

<p>The characteristics we have so briefly alluded to as marking the two
classes of nations, namely, mysterious grandeur among the Northmen, and
among the Greeks ideality, grandness, and vividness of conception, might
by skillful hands be traced in more modern times under the influence of
an ever-changing and growing civilization. I will only allude, in
passing, to a few prominent points.</p>

<p>The literature of Greece, as we know it, had already reached its hight,
two thousand years before our time. It was already gray with years
before the North had begun its infancy. Homer is the boundary which is
insurmountably opposed to our further retrospection, and Homer is
already the beginning of perfection in Greek letters. Of earlier periods
we can but conjecture that there must have been such, bearing a
character analogous to the relics of those nations whose fabulous
history is better known to us. Northern literature can hardly be said to
have had an existence till within the last hundred years. Before that
time we must look for all phases of progress and germs of progress in
the physical and animal character of the nation, their social and
political features and relations. The vividness and ideality of the
ancients find their natural change in the more purely impassioned style
of more modern Southern poetry. Their creations have naturally lost with
the fall of paganism, the supernatural endowments they had, and
retaining in some their ideality, they have hightened and fired the
human nature they depict by the addition of wilder and more flaming
passions, of love that consumes, and ambition, revenge, and hatred that
destroy. Thus we again obtain consistent characters governed by human
laws, but raised above the ordinary mass of men by different qualities
from those which ennobled ideal creations among the ancients. Repose
still constitutes greatness in some instances; but the inner man is made
all fire, and seething metal, ever-burning and quenchless. Elevation and
subtlety of ideas naturally follow these causes, they are another
natural growth of the simple ideality of conception.</p>

<p>The Northern character at the present day has very different qualities.
Though renowned for philosophical and metaphysical prose, yet their
poetry they require to deal with realities and not with ideas; it must
be clear as a fountain, and any opaqueness is an inexcusable flaw. They
are yet in the infancy of literature, and the imagination is still more
sensuous than acute and subtle. However much they court abstractions in
prose, in verse they love only the actual, the real, the tangible.
Nature, and not metaphysics, are the subjects of their poetry, and they
still preserve a freshness and simplicity reminding of more ancient and
ruder days, delightful amidst the hair-splitting of most modern poetry.
Their infancy is like the infancy of all national literatures,
peculiarly modified by the advanced state of civilization in which their
birth was thrown. At first sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> there seems something unnatural and
unaccountable in this apparent contradiction in the character of the
nation, manifested respectively in their prose and their poetry. But on
farther examination all becomes clear as a spring day. Their prose was,
as their whole literature might and should have been, contemporary with
their civilization through its various phases. Metaphysics is the last
refinement, or rather, corruption, which national literature undergoes.
Their prose had naturally arrived at this stage when the true poetic
feeling woke for the first time. And in spite of the rational tendencies
of the age, it assumed that character of warm, bodily imagination which
marks all early literatures. The tendency to the mysterious and the
superhuman has mostly vanished, and more vivid conceptions of every
thing have, under their Christian development, taken the place of dim
magic and weird creations. Northern poets still delight in dealing with
those wonderful poetical inventions of their own ancient mythology, and
revel among the elves and dwarfs that surround the bosoms of mountains
and woods. Lif, with her golden hair, Gerda, with cheeks like auroras,
the cunning Loke, with his mixture of guile, wickedness and deceit,
Thor's mighty Mj&ouml;lner, and the mead-horns of Walhalla&mdash;from among these
wonderful beings, they have culled with a careless hand, and every sprig
and flower is radiant with poetic beauty. The taste for old legends and
traditions has revived within a few years, and scholars and antiquarians
are now laying open unknown mines of treasure.</p>

<h2><a name="A_TRUE_ROMANCE" id="A_TRUE_ROMANCE"></a>A TRUE ROMANCE.</h2>


<p>Among my friends at Rome, during a few weeks that I spent there, was one
old resident of the 'Eternal City' whom I had often begged to give me
some authentic narrative of Catholic experience. He was naturally
reserved, jealously truthful, a 'know-nothing' upon religious
controversy, not at all the man to invent an exciting story, not fond of
legends, Romish or Genevan, not a violent partisan of republicanism in
church or state, and not familiar enough with American thought to
suspect the use that might be made in the United States of such an
incident as I am now to repeat. In fact, as I compare him with other
sources of intelligence open to travelers, sure as I am that no one
could question his belief of whatever he told, every weight that
character, intelligence, years, experience, could confer, rests upon
the only monkish secret which he professed to know. One night he
invited me to a subterranean restaurant, famous for its excellent
creature-comforts, and there over some royal English beer, without any
graces of style or attempts to exaggerate the incidents, he unfolded
what I believe to be a true record of unblessed love.</p>

<p>General readers are familiar with the fact that many a nun immures
herself for life under a sort of moral compulsion, because her high-born
family has become too indigent to maintain its stately style of living,
because the lady herself is in danger of contracting some degrading
alliance, declines peremptorily such connection as her relations
approve, or has committed some imprudence that clouds over her future
prospects. The secret influences which entangle men in the Catholic
orders correspond to this. It would be arrant bigotry to doubt that some
offer up an unstained heart, in aspirations for usefulness or sighs for
holiness; but many times a youth is led blindfold to the altar by
ambitious relatives, like Talleyrand, and discovers too late his perfect
unfitness for the vow he has assumed. And these last are they whose
lives become a scandal to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> profession, whose levity shocks so many
Protestant observers, whose consciences have no true peace, who die
sometimes in open unbelief and, living, are the worst enemies of the
cause they advocate.</p>

<p>As my story goes, at nearly the same time that a gallant young man of
high family disappeared from the gay circles of Rome, a lovely girl of
distinguished parentage had suffered her blonde tresses to be shorn, her
graceful limbs draped in forlorn russet, her merry meetings with girlish
spirits like herself exchanged for the tears of the confessional, the
lengthened prayers of the cloister, the frequent fastings and sometimes
scourgings of monastic life. The cause of this contemporaneous
disappearance was known only to the most intimate friends of two
celebrated but no longer wealthy families, who deemed the sacrifice
necessary, and so recked not of the wounds it might make, the perjuries
it might tempt, the life-struggle of duty with feeling it might cause.</p>

<p>Time passed on. Forgotten by society, it was supposed these victims of
artificial life had forgotten the circles they were wont to charm,
forgotten almost themselves in a system most ingeniously arranged to
blot out one's individuality and to make its subject a perfectly ordered
part of a grand machine. But, unsuspected by their friends, unknown to
their superiors, these two pledged hearts had met. Love will break
through even convent-walls, will speak amidst monastic silence, will
rise unbidden under ascetic discipline. No one can tell, very few can
imagine how they agreed upon their trysting hour. Through a neglected
drain, from some underground apartment, where she had been imprisoned
for negligence, the slender form of the delicate maiden worked its way
into the free air where her lover awaited her in the eagerness of a
stolen pleasure; and the hours supposed to be given to prayer or repose
flew fast in the worship of the 'winged god.' If I recollect rightly,
there were deeply-shaded groves not far from their place of meeting, in
which they felt secure from observation during the night season.</p>

<p>But Love has always been blind to its own peril: a prudent lover would
be indeed a black swan; if such there have been, these were not. And one
night, when the beautiful nun would return through the friendly passage
in season, that her absence might not be detected when the sisters were
summoned to their matin service, the rain, whose torrents she had not
noticed while her lover's arm sheltered her, had filled up the only
pathway to her cell, and not even by the hazard of life could she
recover her room once more. A few hours more, and her absence would
inevitably come to light, would be fearfully punished, if not by a death
such as Scott portrays in one of his poetical legends, by a disgrace far
worse than physical suffering, from which nothing but the grave could
give her relief. The alternative, flight, where no provision had been
made, with no possible help from any friend, with the likelihood of
treachery where they might least expect it, seemed impossible.</p>

<p>In despair rather than hope, the forlorn lady recollected that her
uncle, who had some spiritual supervision over the Roman convents,
though he was sure to be more outraged by her misstep than any one else,
had (besides the motive of shielding a family name from disgrace)
perhaps some remaining affection for his favorite niece. At any rate, if
she were to die, she thought it would be a satisfaction to die humanely,
by the speedy stroke of offended honor than by such cruel penances as
would slowly wear life away. And, what might she not hope, if there were
still one humane drop in that aged bosom, one indulgent memory of
youthful passion beneath that austere cowl, one fond thought of a
childhood which seemed to herself a dream of paradise, when his hand
blessed her curling head, and his lips gave a parting kiss, returned so
heartily by herself.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>&mdash;they hardly knew how time had sped, but
they had never found his wings slow when they were together. So, hand in
hand they hastened to the presence which was to be either deliverance or
condemnation to them both; and when at last they reached the palace, and
after some delay were admitted to kneel before his eminence, no words
can paint the horror with which he exchanged his dreams of the papal
chair for a sight of the apostate priest and self-doomed nun confessing
in one breath that they had 'loved not wisely, but too well'&mdash;that God
once brought together those whom cruel relatives tore asunder&mdash;that <i>he</i>
was their only escape from double ruin, and infamy worse than death.</p>

<p>The moments seemed hours while he who had approved the punishment of
other celibates for no greater sins, sought how he might ward off a blow
that struck so near his own bosom&mdash;that was to crush one the grace of
whose childhood had not been more marked than her affection for
himself&mdash;than the earnestness of the tone with which she was wont to
declare herself 'his little daughter.' He had not the courage to hazard
his position by espousing her cause or undertaking her escape. He felt
that she had been more sinned against than sinning, in having been
forced into a vow of perpetual virginity when she had already made
another vow which her loving nature had rejoiced to keep.</p>

<p>And yet, the preservation of his dignity was of infinite moment to his
peace&mdash;nor could he help seeing that a flood of disgrace would sweep
over the Church were such breaches widened by the public protection of
the offenders, and, of course, the enemies of monastic institutions
would seize upon the opening for fiercer assaults.</p>

<p>Suddenly he dismissed the erring brother in too much trouble to bestow
the admonition which the other was in too great anxiety to heed&mdash;threw
over the trembling girl the cloak and hat of a common citizen&mdash;summoned
his household servants together as quickly as possible, and hastened in
the twilight of early dawn to the sleeping convent with as large an
attendance as such hot haste would permit.</p>

<p>For some time no admittance could be obtained; and the rain seemed to
pour down in sheets, as if all the windows of heaven were open. But his
orders were peremptory, his authority was ample, his excuse ingenuity
itself: 'He had just heard that a man was secreted within those
consecrated walls; he was determined to see for himself, if he had to
tear one stone from another; under his supervision no such infamy should
be so much as suspected.' And so, making a virtue of necessity, the
panic-struck lady abbess yielded her dignity, and the <i>posse</i> of
pretended inspectors stood within the drowsy walls before one rose-tint
in the East threatened their secret with exposure.</p>

<p>So responsible an official could not be satisfied with seeing the nuns
together, or witnessing their earliest chapel-service; he must enter
every room, survey every cranny, and leave no possibility of deception,
no corner for concealment. And posting some of his servants&mdash;whose
excessive watchfulness might prove a little inconvenient&mdash;at the two
principal entrances, with his remaining attendants he proceeded orderly
from room to room, the superior refusing, as was expected, to sanction
by her presence such an invasion of the sacred privacy of her
institution. When they reached the cell adjoining that where our tale
properly ends, the disguised nun was far enough in the rear of the
feebly-lighted party, and they too busy in the pretended search, for her
disappearance to be noticed&mdash;her uncle had made her see that this was
the only chance&mdash;so, flinging the coat and hat through an open window
into the yard, she glided with ghost-like tread into her own apartment,
and when the drowsy servitors opened her door, she was seen upon her
knees before the crucifix, praying more fervently than ever the jubilant
prayer of a newly-rescued soul.</p>

<p>The trouble threatened to lead to some farther difficulties. For these
ladies were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> of the Roman aristocracy, and their honor had been
impeached, their sanctuary invaded, their solemn asseverations had been
disregarded, their protector had become their accuser. It might have
gone hard with the father who had planned this ingenious device to save
his name from disgrace and shield his niece from suffering. But, just
before the party turned from the convent-gate, a keen eye detected the
fallen mantle; and the trophy was exhibited to the agitated superior, in
proof that some of the forbidden sex had been lurking around, and had
stolen away in terror from so formidable a search; she was warned to new
vigilance, and offered every assistance for the future which the papal
guards could bestow.</p>

<p>And so ends all that my informant knew of the love-lost girl. Her
accomplice in guilt, who did not desert her till he saw there was hope
in her uncle's face, was hurried away as a missionary to South-America;
and, as the waves of the sea rolled between him and his only object of
affection, he must have 'rejoiced with trembling' that the crimson waves
of death had not mingled her and him in a common doom. He wanted the
independence to detect the injustice of a system which made a pure
attachment guilt, and its discovery condemnation; so he raised no
protesting voice against it. Truly, the day of strange stories in Italy
is not yet over.</p>

<h2><a name="HUGUENOTS_OF_NEW-YORK_CITY" id="HUGUENOTS_OF_NEW-YORK_CITY"></a>HUGUENOTS OF NEW-YORK CITY.</h2>


<p>Governor Stuyvesant was among the earliest to encourage the emigration
of the Huguenots to New-York, and whose descendants for generations have
ranked with our best and most honorable citizens. On the twenty-fourth
of January, 1664, N. Van Beck, a merchant in New-Amsterdam, received
letters from Rochelle, stating the wish of some French Protestants to
settle in New-Netherland, as their religious rights had been invaded and
their churches burned. The Governor and Council resolved to receive them
kindly, and grant them lands gratuitously. In a letter of M. de
Denonville to the French government, dated sixteenth November, 1686, he
reports that fifty or sixty 'men, Huguenots,' arrived at New-Amsterdam,
'who are establishing themselves at Manat, (New-Amsterdam,) and its
environs. I know that some have arrived at Boston, from France.'
Although the waves of the Atlantic divided the two countries, the French
King does not seem to have forgiven his banished subjects in America. In
his instructions to Count De Frontenac, respecting the expedition from
Canada against New-York, and dated seventh June, 1689, he directs him to
'send to France the French refugees, whom he will find there,
<i>particularly those of the pretended Reformed Religion</i>,' or Huguenots.
His royal but remorseless spirit was not gratified, however, as the
French did not venture to attack New-York, and instead of their
Protestant brethren being sent back to France, a few years afterward
they erected a church for their own religious services. This was <i>Du
Saint-Esprit</i>, and built on Pine street, directly opposite to the
present Custom-House, by the Huguenots and Walloon settlers, the last of
whom were a part of the French Protestants, although they emigrated to
America from the river 'Wael.' An earlier French chapel had been erected
on Marketfield street, then called Petticoat Lane, near the Battery. It
was an humble edifice, but hither, every Lord's day, the Huguenots from
the city, Stat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>en Island, the Wallabagh, and New-Rochelle, by wagons, in
which they lodged, were wont to assemble to worship God, without the
fear of royal, persecuting edicts, or armed bands. <i>L'Eglise
Saint-Esprit</i> was founded in the year 1704, with a cemetery adjoining.
It was a plain, neat, stone building, and nearly square&mdash;its bell the
gift of Sir Henry Ashurst, of London. On its tablet in front was
inscribed: &AElig;DES SACRA GALLOR PROT. REFORM. FONDA. 1704. PENITUS REPAR.
1741. In our day its sacred walls have been taken down, the dead
removed, and the venerable spot, like many others in our busy city, is
now devoted to Mammon. The successors of <i>Saint-Esprit</i> long since
united with the Episcopalians, and erected the beautiful marble church
in Leonard street, where the doctrines of the ever-blessed Reformation
continue to be declared in the same language in which they were so
eloquently preached two centuries ago, by Claude, Laurin, and other
Reformed French Ministers.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Laboire was the first pastor of the <i>Saint-Esprit</i>, which
soon numbered a flourishing congregation. Some of its members would walk
from New-Rochelle, on Saturday night, to worship God in this place, and
thus spending the holy day, would return home again in the evening,
joyfully singing Marot's old French hymns to cheer them by the way. The
Staten-Island Huguenots would make the same pious journey in their light
skiffs and boats. For some years Mr. Laboire, the pastor, toward his
support was 'allowed a yearly sallary of twenty pounds per ann. out of
y<sup>e</sup> Revenue of this Province.' The religious services were here
performed in the primitive manner of the French Calvinistic churches;
but after the sovereignty of the English was established over the Dutch,
the forms of their church worship were gradually introduced, until at
length the Huguenot congregation united with the Protestant Episcopal,
in this diocese.</p>

<p>In the <i>Documentary History of New-York</i>, vol iii. p. 427, may be found
an old curious article, entitled, 'A Full and Just Discovery of the weak
and slender foundation of a most Pernicious <span class="smcap">Slander</span>, raised
against the <span class="smcap">French Protestant Refugees</span>, inhabiting the Province
of New-York, generally, but more particularly affecting Captain

<p>It appears that one Morris Newinhuysen, a mate of a vessel, in 1706, was
taken by the French, and a prisoner of war, at New-York, reported that
the 'French Protestants' here corresponded with 'the inhabitants of
France, tending to the taking and destruction of this city, by Her
Majesty's declared enemies.' The New-York Huguenots considered this
accusation a 'crime of so high a nature in itself,' and so 'altogether
false and untrue,' as to petition Governor Burnet to cause 'the said
Morris Newinhuysen, and all others who may appear concerned, to be
strictly examined upon the same report, and if found out, be punished
according to the nature of the crime.' This petition is dated 'February
10, 1707/8,' and signed by 'Stephen D'Lancey, Elias Nezereau, Abraham
Jouneau, Thomas Bayeux, Elias Neau, Paul Deoilet, Augustus Jay, Jean
Cazale, Benjamin Fanuel.' These must have been leading Huguenots at the
time. To another petition of a similar character, we find the names of
Daniel Cromelin, John Auboyneau, Francis Vincent, Alexander Allaire. His
Excellency the Governor, ordered the report to be considered, which was
done, when his Council reported that there was not 'any ground to
suspect Captain Faneuil of holding a correspondence with France.' This
was cheering news to the 'French Refugees' in the Province of New-York,
as such a slanderous report, to use their own language on the occasion,
was 'of pernicious consequence to all the French refugees in general,
and disturbs their peace and quiet, and ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>structs that affection and
familiarity which they had formerly enjoyed with the other inhabitants
of this Province, to their just grief and resentment.'</p>

<p>The Rev. Louis Rou was also a pastor of the 'Reformed Protestant French
Church in New-York.' As early as the year 1713, among other names in its
official records, are found John Barberie, elder, Louis Carr&eacute;, ancien,
Jean Lafont, ancien, Andr&eacute; Fuyneau, ancien.' During the year 1724, there
was great excitement in the French congregation, caused by a party
question. Stephen De Lancey, a wealthy merchant, and patron of the
church, with others became dissatisfied with the pastor. He was
dismissed for want of zeal, and for innovations which they contended he
had introduced into their church discipline; but the minister, with his
friends, appealed from this decision to Governor Burnet and his Council,
when they sustained him. Indignant memorials were published by both
parties, and things went so far, that when De Lancey was elected to the
Colonial Assembly, the Governor refused to administer his oath of
office, alleging that he was not a subject of the British crown. De
Lancey, the Huguenot, contended that he had left France before the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and had received denization in
England, under the great seal of James II. He was right, and the
Assembly sustained his argument and claims against his Excellency the
'Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the Provinces of New-York,
New-Jersies, and Territories thereon depending in America.'</p>

<p>For the curious in old families, among the official friends of the
French minister, we find James Gou, John Hastier, Elias Pelletreau, Jr.,
Jean Va Chan, Andrew Foucault, Jacques Bobin, N. Cazalet, Samuel
Bourdet, David Le Febrer, Francois Bourdet, Peter Morgat. They testify
to Mr. Rou's 'exemplary piety and instruction for upwards of fourteen
years,' which 'have rendered him exceedingly estimable to all who knows
him, which can't but be acknowledged even by those who are now the
occasion of this trouble.' We find a more general list of French
families, his friends also, and dated thirty-first December, 1724, and
they speak well of him, 'with edification, always leading an exemplary
life:' James Bergerron, Francis Bosset, Daniel Girand, Daniel Gailliard,

Rou, Judith Morget, Martha Pentereau, Mary Bargeau, Susanne Boutecon,

<p>At this period, a Rey. Mr. Moulinars was the assistant minister of Mr.
Rou, and united with the party who opposed him, and they also have left
records of their views, in which they claim to have paid Mr. Rou in
full, and that then the Consistory could dismiss him when they saw fit.
'We are not indebted unto Mr. Rou one farthing for all the time he hath
served us,' is their language, and to their official act are the
signatures of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> 'I. I. Moulinars, ministre, John Barheweeld, Louis
Carr&eacute;ansien, Abraham Gouneau, ans., Fran. Cazalz, ans., Ren&eacute; Het, ans.,
January twenty-eighth, 1724.' Still the Council decided in favor of Mr.
Rou, and were 'of opinion that the said congregation be admonished that
every person in it do all in his power to preserve peace and unanimity
in their congregation.' That body also advised 'that the ministers of
the French congregation who shall officiate next Sunday be ordered to
read publicly the said opinion and admonition, immediately after divine
service in the forenoon.'</p>

<p>All these efforts did not produce harmony in the French congregation.
Moulinars evidently had a restless spirit, and was much opposed to the
Church of England, at that time the established religion of the New-York
Colony, and respected by many of the Huguenots. Through his efforts, a
'meeting-house' was erected for the French refugees at New-Rochelle, and
its members numbered one hundred persons. One old document (May twelfth,
1725) records 'that the said Mr. Moulinars has declared (as can be
proved) that he finds our Church (Episcopal) and that of Rome as like
one another as two fishes can be ... and one of the chiefest reasons of
this violence against Mr. Rou has no other ground than his constant
affection to the Church, and the public approbation he has at all times
given to its ceremonies and doctrines.' The churchmen also complained
that Moulinars caused 'great prejudice in general to the Church of
England, and in particular to that of New-Rochelle, where he would come
quarterly from New-York, and plead among the people.' New-Rochelle was
then a parish, and its rector, of course, considered the French preacher
a dissenter. From the parochial account of the former, the town embraced
two Quaker families, three Dutch ones, four Lutherans, and several of
the French; and the Huguenots settling among them in the year 1726,
gathered a congregation of 'about one hundred persons.'</p>

<p>The Rev. Messrs. Daille and Labord appear early to have served the
French Protestant Church in New-York; but of the latter we have learned
nothing. The former had been pastor awhile to the French Protestants in
Boston. About the year 1690, the Dutch Church Consistory employed Mr.
Daille to preach to the French in their own language, at New-York, and
also to conduct the religious services of the pulpit during a part of
the Lord's day.</p>

<p>In 1763, Jean Carll was the pastor of Du Saint-Esprit, for we discover
his name, together with Peter Vallade and James Desbrosses, the present
elders, Daniel Bounet and Charles Jardine, the present deacons of the
French Protestant Church in the city of New-York, to a petition for a
charter. Their church property, they state, was purchased agreeable to
an act of the Legislature in 1703; 'a decent edifice for the public
worship of Almighty God, according to the usage of the French Protestant
Churches,' erected; 'and the residue they devoted to the use of the
cemetery or church-yard for the interment of their dead.' 'Ever since,
they have maintained a succession of ministers there, who have dispensed
the ordinances of divine worship in the French tongue.' Besides this
property, they received the rents of a house and parcel of ground in the
township of Breucklin, on Nassau Island, near the ferry, and the French
Church now asked from the legislative authorities a proper charter. With
honest pride they boast, in their petition, of the most inviolable
fidelity 'to all those indulgent states and powers who protected them
from the merciless rage of their Popish persecutors. As your petitioners
in particular are the descendants of a people who suffered the greatest
hardships and flew from their native country to preserve the purity of
the Christian faith and worship.' Eloquent and truthful words. The
Huguenots were a great blessing to every land where they settled. The
name of their body politic was 'the Ministers, Elders, and Deacons of
the Protestant French Church of the City of New-York.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>During the Revolutionary War, New-York became literally a city of
prisons. The pews of the North Dutch Church in William street were used
for fuel, and eight hundred American prisoners were incarcerated within
its old walls, without fuel or bedding, and here many died from cold and
starvation. The 'Brick Meeting,' in Beekman street, was also used at
first for a prison, and afterward changed into an hospital. The
Rose-street Friends' Meeting-house and the Wall-street Presbyterian
church became hospitals also, and Du Saint-Esprit was made a d&eacute;p&ocirc;t for
military stores. The Middle Dutch, the present Post-Office, stripped of
its sacred furniture, was the abode of three thousand American
prisoners. 'Here,' says John Pintard, himself a most respectable member
of the Protestant French Church near by, and an eye-witness of the
disgusting sight, 'the prisoners taken on Long Island and at Fort
Washington&mdash;sick, wounded, and well&mdash;were all indiscriminately huddled
together by hundreds and thousands, large numbers of whom died by
disease, and many were undoubtedly poisoned by their inhuman attendants,
for the sake of their watches or silver buckles.' The suffering inmates
were afterward transferred to other places of confinement, and the
venerable building turned into a riding-school for the British dragoons.
Its floor was taken up, the ground covered with tan-bark, and the
window-sashes removed for this sacrilegious purpose. The French Huguenot
church remained in its original form one hundred and thirty years, until
1834, when it was taken down, the grounds sold, and its dead disinterred
and removed to other resting-places. In their native lands, the ashes of
the Huguenots would sometimes be dug up, burned, and scattered by
persecuting hands to the winds of the heavens; but in ours&mdash;Protestant
and more favored&mdash;their sainted dust, wherever buried, is watched and
preserved with pious care and affectionate fidelity. It would be a
pleasant but an impossible duty to trace the histories of thousands of
our most excellent New-Yorkers, whose pious ancestors worshiped God in
the old sanctuary of Du Saint-Esprit, and whose ashes reposed, in
Christian hope, alongside of its humble and venerable walls. But records
are scarcely to be found. Still we may love their characters and strive
to imitate their noble and generous virtues. Hallowed be those precious
memories!</p>

<p>The remains of many Huguenots repose among the innumerable dead of old
Trinity church-yard, that vast home of the departed; and where can be
found their memorials of honor, patriotism, and exalted piety. Here lie
the ashes of the Rev. Elias Neau, near its northern porch. He was a man
of more than ordinary eminence; his life useful, beneficial, and
religious. Mr. Neau was the paternal ancestor of Mrs. Commodore Oliver
H. Perry, of Rhode-Island.</p>

<p>Previous to his escape from France, he suffered confinement for several
years in the prisons and galleys, and while in his dungeons, learned by
heart the liturgy, and became attached to the English Church service.
When the Rev. Mr. Vesey was rector of Trinity, Mr. Neau was appointed
catechist of that church. For a number of years, he faithfully
discharged the duties of this important appointment among the Indians
and the slaves, of whom some fifteen hundred were catechumens in the
city of New-York. He could only collect them together on Sunday nights,
after the last public services; and when properly prepared, would
present them to Mr. Vesey, for baptism. Mr. Neau may be said to have
founded the Free School of Trinity, an institution so useful and well
known among the noble charities of New-York. Its former tablet is still
preserved among the mementoes of the olden time. This excellent Huguenot
closed his useful life in 1722, resting from his earthly labors
alongside of God's holy temple, where he had so long worshiped and'
served him.</p>

<p>The Rev. Elias Neau, his wife Susannah, and daughter Judith, left
France, for America, with the Huguenots, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> 1685. Judith married a
Rabineau in New-York, and their only child, Marie, married Daniel
Ayrault; their issue was six sons and five daughters; and the second
son, Daniel, married Susannah Eargrass, whose children were Daniel and
Mary Ayrault. Mary married Benjamin Mason, and their children were two
sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Benjamin Mason, M.D., was
educated in England, marrying Margaret Champlin, of Newport, R. I., and
their issue was three sons and one daughter. This daughter, Elizabeth
Champlin Mason, became the wife of the patriotic and brave Captain
Oliver Hazard Perry, of the United States Navy. From this last union
were four sons and one daughter, Elizabeth Mason Perry. This daughter
married the Rev. Francis Vinton; and their children, seven sons and
three daughters, make the <i>eighth</i> generation from their venerable,
pious Huguenot ancestor; Mr. Vinton himself serving in holy things at
the same sacred altar of old Trinity, where the Rev. Elias Neau
worshiped, and after a lapse of one hundred and fifty years. How
enduring is sacred truth! It will abide forever.</p>

<p>Johannes Delamontagnie was another Huguenot refugee, who reached
New-Amsterdam in 1773. Governor Kieft appointed him a member of his
council, then the second office in the colonial government. He purchased
a farm of two hundred acres at Harlaem, for seven hundred and twenty
dollars, naming it' Vriedendel', (Valley of Peace.) The land was
situated East of the Eighth Avenue, between Ninety-third street and the
Harlem river. His grandson, named Vincent, died in May, 1773, at the
very advanced age of one hundred and sixteen years. Numerous descendants
are still among us from this early French Protestant emigrant, although
some abbreviations have been made in the name.</p>

<p>While sharing the Provost-Marshal's office, in Portsmouth, Virginia, I
was struck with the almost utter absence of cultivation of the
understanding of the people living there or in the surrounding country,
who entered to obtain passes, or for other purposes. Scarce one of them
at first appreciated the nature of an oath, which they all shrank from
taking, or objected to, when proposed as a condition of obtaining either
the passes or the protection they wished. They were not merely
illiterate and untaught, but showed also an extremely low grade of
reasoning power. There was, indeed, in most cases, but little
development even of those lower grades of intellectual ability which are
so frequently seen in simply 'illiterate' persons. They hung back from
committing themselves, in any way, as friendly to us, though they
evidently did not feel that hatred or ill-feeling characteristic of the
bolder secessionist. I afterward saw many more of these people, in
Norfolk, at our office. With our continued occupancy of the city, and in
the absence of any aggressive action by our Government, they presented
themselves more frequently. Among them there was occasionally one who
avowed himself, without reservation, for the Union. These people are, I
am confident, the only ones in the rebellious States who are other than
secessionists. Love of the Union&mdash;that which the reader identifies with
patriotism and nationality&mdash;they had not, because this can nowhere be
found in the rebellious States, except in isolated instances. That they
remained silent and subdued under the progress of the acts of the
secessionists, and never raised hand or voice in contradiction to them,
proves in this class an absence of that force of character, or of that
moral courage or 'energy' which is the distinguishing attribute of our
Northern people, even the poorest, and this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> also evinced when we
first occupied the town. It was not peacefulness of disposition which I
remarked, but the lack first, of <i>decision of character</i>, and next, of
<i>decision of understanding</i> respecting the questions at issue. In
conversation they could express only very simple notions, nor could I
promptly elicit more from them. Even their feelings lacked the qualities
of force and intensity. Yet this class is next to the ruling and leading
part of the population, which is composed of planters, cotton, tobacco,
and produce factors' families, professional men, and others, who court
patronage, including shopkeepers, small manufacturers, and
money-lenders, and who support in political affairs <i>their</i> own
<i>client&eacute;le</i> of supporters. The latter people constitute the determinedly
rebellious. It is the first class only, that we can regard as the sole
support to Unionism which there is in the rebellious States; but in them
we shall find no moral force or power even when the reign of the leading
class shall have ceased. These facts, I am aware, are in striking
contrast to the usual estimation of the courage and daring of the people
of the South. But the usual estimation is true only of the people who
have a concert of interest in slavery, and who, whatever their petty
disagreements may be, concur in their politics. Nowhere, therefore, is
democracy less actual than in the rebellious States; a ruling and a
subservient class exists precisely as in England or Austria. To increase
the latter, comprising the people I first described, is by no means to
increase the power and extend the domination of the other, but the
contrary; and undoubtedly the diminution of their number by the
sacrifice of their lives in the rebellion, is considered by the chief
managers as desirable, in view of the success of their scheme of polity
and government.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in enforcing their plan of formally identifying the various
States with secession&mdash;the form being the ordinance of secession&mdash;the
suffrages and sense of this ruled class were ruthlessly unheeded, and
denied validity.</p>

<p>Hence we say that several of the rebel States did not 'secede,' it being
true that a majority of the people expressed their aversion to
rebellion&mdash;this majority being, for the occasion, the ruling one, in
virtue of the principle to which <i>all</i> equally deferred. But it is the
<i>will</i> of the ruling or aristocratic class in all similar cases, and not
the forms of law or principle, which accomplishes such changes, whether
according to the forms of law or in disregard of them. <i>This class are
never respecters of principle</i>, but rule in virtue not of what
principles empower them to do, as a majority, but of the power of might
and dominant strength. It is obvious that were they to do the former,
they would be destitute of any other power than pertained to the whole
community, they in part, and others equally. Accordingly, they having,
once for all, in their adhesion to the Constitution, and again on its
eve, consented to an election, and therefore its issue, when a majority
of the entire nation elected a representative of the Chicago
declaration, they reverted to their power of might, and rebelled.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, the subversion of an <i>un</i>principled (the term is of
the strictest accuracy) ruling class, or aristocracy, and the
obliteration of their peculiar power, that we have to accomplish. This
power consists wholly of certain peculiar interests as masters. To
deprive them of these, is the only possible terminus of the question at
issue. So plain and palpable is the whole question, that we need hardly
say that their whole scheme of government turns upon and clusters about
this interest. For the preservation of this interest, which they thought
touched by the advances of freedom, they rushed into war, and for the
conservation of their power, they base all upon it.</p>

<p>That the general question of property is at all affected by the
obliteration of this interest, is an egregious error. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> property, the
possession of which is valid and inviolable, is the product of human
skill, industry, labor, invention, or what not. Nor does it confer
political dominance on its possessor. The slaveholders are the only
class in the nation whose property interest does so; and reciprocally,
the sole object of the maintenance of this interest is the maintenance
of this dominant power. Whether it be or be not criminal to possess it,
is not the point upon which the demand for the abrogation of this
interest turns&mdash;at least, there is no legal precedent to so think of
it&mdash;but it turns upon the fact that it is ruinous to a republican
system. Not the whole force of republicanism can at once maintain itself
and conserve and cherish <i>that</i>; and <i>if</i> it, to a certain extent
cherish it, it will do no more than continue the basis of the power of a
class, who will use it in the only way it can be used, namely, in
contesting whatever interests, principles, or practices are averse to
it.</p>

<p>Hence, for more than thirty years not a single widely beneficent measure
of legislation has been allowed to pass and become operative by the
representatives of this interest. So the South, the seat of this
interest, has always been, in its own estimation, 'the South,' despite
what we have said of a national Union; rendering it impossible that the
republican patriot could <i>unite</i> in one sentiment that which this
particular interest <i>divided</i> itself from.</p>

<p>That humanity should dictate the freedom of the slave in the interests
of morality, is but natural. With this we have nothing to do; but that
the being of an 'aristocracy based on property' should be excluded from
the bounds of a republic, is of an importance to it and mankind, not
second to religion itself.</p>

<p>The Chinese thief, they say, greases himself and sticks knives in his
queue, so that it is nest to impossible to catch him. Old Time is about
as slippery a fellow as a Chinese thief. I don't know that he has a
queue, and have fancied that when queues were worn, and Time was in the
fashion, some old fogy, too slow to keep up with him, caught him by his
queue. Time, who never yet was detained by mortal grasp, pressed on and
left it behind. Since then he has cultivated only that <i>ungraspable</i>
forelock. Fleet of foot as he is, it is thought that Young America, with
his telegraphs, will, in the long run&mdash;that is, in the race round the
world&mdash;come out 'a leetle ahead' of him. Indeed, Young America talks of
annihilating Time. But, though he may have 'one foot on land and one on
sea,' he has no commission to 'swear that time shall be no more.'</p>

<p>We are a fast people&mdash;no mistake. Perhaps a little too fast. Did we only
<i>anticipate</i> Time, and pull down only what, with those sure sappers and
miners of his, the years, he is certain to overthrow, it would be well
enough. But we wish to destroy what he has left untouched, or would
remodel it, would modernize it.</p>

<p>The dear old creed of our fathers; <i>old</i> creed, did I say? Ever <i>new</i>
creed; for what Time passes by, never grows old. This we would change to
suit ourselves, fancying we have outgrown it; or thinking it, like the
Spartan iron coin, too cumbersome for general circulation, we would
change it for lighter, and as we think, more precious metal. We deem
this the age of gold.</p>

<p>There is a great deal said about our progress toward mental and moral
perfection. Some seem to think that education is all we need to make us
perfect moral beings. 'Ignorance is the cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> of all evil;' all things
are as they should be; our minds are as the <i>camera obscura</i>, a darkened
chamber which a few rays enter, and every thing only <i>appears</i> upside
down. All we need is more light, to see to set every thing straight. It
is true that we see things in an inverted position; but in this
prison-house, we shall never have light enough to see them as they are.
There is a lens that corrects these false impressions, and the light
that enters through it shows us many things upside down that we before
saw right side up, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Intoxicated with conceit, we fancy that we have but to eat of the tree
of knowledge to become gods. Some go so far as to say that we are even
now a part of divinity. 'The universe&mdash;it is God;' therefore we, as a
part of the universe, are a part of God. The universe God? If it is a
part of God, (which it is not,) it is so small a fraction that in all
mathematical calculations, it would be called nothing. Were all the
minds in the universe mingled into one, that one would be but as a drop
to the ocean that girdles Infinity&mdash;God.</p>

<p>You will think me too earnest. The O'Mollys were ever an earnest race
and an orthodox race. With what earnestness did they, in the good old
times, from those peculiarly Irish goblets, that wouldn't stand, drink
Irish whisky, till they partook of the nature of the goblets and came to
the floor with them&mdash;the goblets with a crash, but the O'Mollys got up
as sound as a bell, and next morning were ready to attend mass, into
which they entered with as much earnestness as into their revelry. No
people equal the Irish in earnestness in <i>spiritual</i> matters. It is
perhaps not for a female O'Molly to record these roysterings; but I am
the last of my race, I only am left to chronicle the glorious doings of
my ancestors. Then, too, on our escutcheon is one of these same goblets.
The origin of this escutcheon it has been a family task to trace, with
but little success, however, till the present generation, I had a cousin
who inherited all the family pride. He became a martyr to his devotion
to the 'time-honored custom;' for alas! good old Irish whisky is as
certainly among the 'things that were,' as are the Irish kings. Some
have shrewdly thought that it was the only real Irish king. Well, then,
it is owing to this cousin's loyalty to the usurper, or rather
pretender, that I am the family chronicler. He was wonderfully
ingenious; could from the slightest hint guess at the whole story; he
was equal to those naturalists who from one bone can make out the
animal. With the remains of an old family tradition for his clue, he
traced the origin of the escutcheon. It was on this wise. One of the
Irish kings, traveling incog., stopped at the castle of an O'Molly, who,
though he knew not the rank of his guest, entertained him with the
utmost hospitality. Freely the goblet circulated, and as they two only
drank from it, it was soon broken. The king, next morning, revealed his
rank to his host, and dubbed him <i>Knight of the Goblet</i>; hence the
goblet on the shield, an emblem of hospitality. And never has there been
a stain on the escutcheon of the O'Mollys.</p>

<p>I said they were an orthodox race. Perhaps they were too bigoted in
their adherence to the old customs and the old faith. But there is too
much latitudinarianism in this nineteenth century. Too many think it
matters but little what a man's belief is, if he is only sincere in it;
as if the consequences of any thing could be averted by not believing in
it. The hands of your clock may be so turned around that they will point
to the wrong figures; does that change the time? Or, what amounts to the
same thing, it may be so ill-regulated, the machinery may be so out of
gear, that you are deceived. But morning, noon, and night do not
regulate their face by your clock. There is a dial that unerringly marks
'the stately stoppings' of the sun of suns&mdash;let us regulate our belief
by it.</p>

<p>Truth is not like the clouds that, it is said, take the form of the
country over which they pass. It does not change to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> suit your condition
or mind, and we can not change it, neither can we dilute it. What is
not truth is falsehood, and this, as the acid dissolved the pearl which
Cleopatra dropped into it, will dissolve truth and convert it into its
own nature.</p>

<p>How little we prize truth, even if we do not thus attempt to dissolve
it. It lies in our heart unheeded. We are almost as unconscious of it as
the oyster is of the pearl within his shell.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, having a daughter 'to finish,' looked over
advertisement after advertisement, till finally her eye lighted on the
circular of Mrs. Smith's Female Seminary, situated in the quiet and
salubrious village of&mdash;&mdash;, within a few minutes' walk of three or four
places of worship.... Great care taken of the health, manners, and
morals of the pupils.... Exercise insisted on.... Those whose parents
may wish it, allowed the use of a quiet saddle-horse.... The pupils
under the immediate supervision of the principal.... They have all the
comforts of Home, etc., etc. All this, in addition to a thorough course
of instruction in every thing ever heard of, not forgetting the Use of
the Globes.... Music on the piano and guitar; there are six pianos in
the institution.... Drawing, Monochromatic, Grecian, Oriental, etc.,
etc. Painting in oils and water-colors.... Embroidery, ten different
kinds.... Terms, $&mdash;per annum. Then follows an imposing list of
references, Reverends, Esquires, and Honorables.</p>

<p>My friend, taken with this, decided that her daughter, Bessie, should go
to Mrs. Smith's seminary. Accordingly, a short time before the
commencement of the next term, she accompanied her there; was so pleased
with Mrs. Smith's bland politeness toward herself, and her affectionate,
almost matronly manner toward her daughter, that she came away relieved
of all anxiety on Bessie's account.</p>

<p>I hope I am not 'violating the sanctity of private correspondence,' in
giving the following letter from Bessie:<br /><br /></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">'My Dear Molly</span>: I received yours last evening, and hasten
to reply, though, to answer your numerous questions will take me
till after prayers. I shall consequently, as I am not the <i>model</i>
pupil, get an absence-mark. You inquire as to the advancement I am
making in my studies. One thing is certain, I shall not come home
the <i>encyclopedia</i> mother expects. I'll not say that this
'flourishing institution' is a humbug; but will say that facts and
the circular do not exactly tally. A few of the facts I will give,
and you can judge for yourself.</p>

<p>'To begin with the supervision of the bland, portly principal. She
enters the school-room makes a few criticisms, asks a blessing at
the table; occasionally a misdemeanor is reported to her, when the
offender is cited to the august presence, and duly reprimanded, not
according to the quality of the offense, but, in an inverse
proportion, to the <i>quality</i> of the offender. Her teachers do the
mental drudgery of the institution. Their life is about as varied
and pleasant as that of a churn-dog; that is, if the dog were kept
churning all day. The balancing of accounts with them, and the
making out of the bills for the patrons, are certainly 'under the
immediate supervision of the principal.' These bills, which fond
parents suppose amount to $&mdash;, have a rat-like appendage (excuse
the expression) of 'incidentals,' that wasn't drawn into the
<i>modest</i> 'terms' of the circular. I nearly forgot her Friday
afternoon lectures, for which she sometimes substitutes <i>Hannah
More</i>, and the <i>Young Ladies' Own Book</i>. These lectures are as
commonplace as expatiations on the importance of cultivating the
mind and heart, interspersed with 'hence the necessity,' and
'highly essential,' can mate them. Last Friday, as she was
enlarging on the advantage of having had our birth in an
enlightened, Christian land, Jenny Dean wrote on a slip of paper,
and poked it over to me,'not <i>have</i> our <i>berth</i> in a Christian
land.' Mrs. Smith saw her, confiscated the paper, and gave her a
severe reprimand, for evincing such a disposition to trifle with
serious things. Jenny was right; if ours is a Christian berth,
commend me to heathendom. Mrs. Smith neglected to mention in her
circular the instruction in <i>entomology</i> her pupils receive;
probably because they are, as 'the Autocrat' says every traveler
is, <i>self-taught</i>. I wish she would omit a few lessons in the 'Use
of the Globes,' and teach the servants the use of hot water,
corrosive sublimate, and roach-poison.</p>

<p>'I begin to understand why it is called a <i>finishing</i> school. Don't
tell mother, or she will have me put in quarantine when I return.
But, really, I'm getting quite thin; the demand made on my system
being greater than the supply of 'plain wholesome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> food.' Now, I'm
not going to complain of this 'plain wholesome,' though the butter
is sometimes strong, the lamb (?) ditto, (see circular in regard to
home comforts.) But I wish you would suggest to mother the
propriety of sending me another box; the last we finished in short
metre. You know this is a <i>finishing</i> school. Only one of the girls
of our hall is too mean to <i>treat</i>, and she gets <i>lots of things</i>
from home. Yesterday, she brought a beautiful basket of apples to
my room, just to show me how nice they <i>looked</i>. I suggested that
'the proof of the pudding was in the <i>eating</i>.' She was too obtuse
to take the hint. It is almost sacrilege to talk so about her; she
is Mrs. Smith's <i>model</i> pupil, which, as I before informed you,
your humble servant is not. Jenny Dean and I are always getting
into trouble. Somehow, we've got a bad name, and our <i>slightest</i>
misdemeanor is noticed, so we think that we 'might as well be
killed for a sheep as a lamb:' in other words, if the camel's back
must be broken, it may as well be by a hundred-pound weight as a
feather.</p>

<p>'We have an Italian music-teacher, chiefly noticeable for his
length of limb, an exiled nobleman, of course. I hinted to Jenny a
doubt as to his nobility. She said, if he didn't belong to 'the
Brahmin caste,' he did to the <i>Bramah cast</i>, and that was the next
thing to it. He has become violently attached to the assistant
music-teacher, who is very thin. Now, he has been teaching us to
screech 'For Bonnie Annie Laurie.' Jenny persists in calling it,
For bony Annie Laurie. The gravity with which he each time corrects
her is amusing. Signor <i>executes</i> to the admiration of patrons,
etc.; though music on those horrid pianos is rather like music on
the rack. Of the six inventoried, (see circular,) two are in the
garret, superannuated; two more ought to be; as for the remaining
two, on one of them your friend Bessie practices, and it is too
great a trial to her nerves to speak of them. You say that you have
music in your souls that I must learn to express for you; that you
can't turn a tune to save your life; that the attempt is like the
attempt to make a curve of straight lines, (you see how I remember
all you write or say.) If you were here, you would wish all the
melody of the institution <i>voiceless</i>, and that it wouldn't ooze
out at the finger-ends.</p>

<p>'As for drawing, (see circular,) this department, to save expense,
Mrs. Smith's <i>accomplished</i> daughter has. She teaches crayoning and
pencilling&mdash;a few learn to daub in water-colors&mdash;but this she
rather discourages, as colored crayoning is much easier and quite
as <i>showy</i>&mdash;this is the word for everything here. Miss Smith also
teaches French&mdash;<i>Anglicized</i>. It is hardly worth while to mention
'the solids,' as these are shoved into a corner to give place to
the accomplishments.... As for the exercise&mdash;we do, two or three
times a week, file down the street, then file back again&mdash;are thus
exhibited to the admiring gaze of the Esquires, Reverends, and
Honorables, (see circular.) The 'quiet saddle-horse' (see circular)
is a 'poetic fiction,' a 'pious fraud'&mdash;as much a myth as Pegasus
himself. Though there is a tradition in the school that, a short
time after the founding of the establishment, the late lamented
husband of Mrs. Smith, who was fond of equestrian exercise, kept a
horse&mdash;which a parlor-boarder, niece of Mrs. Smith, was allowed to
ride&mdash;hence the provision in the circular. One part of it is
correct&mdash;he doubtless is now a <i>very</i> quiet saddle-horse&mdash;that is,
if he had not the tenacity of life of the <i>lamb</i> that, judging from
the savory odor, we are to have for dinner, ('what's in a name?')
Perhaps the 'late lamented' was as fond of his nag as was the man
who entertained his guests with his horse in the form of soup.
Jenny Dean says that is what she calls true <i>horse-pitality</i>.</p>

<p>'There goes the bell. Don't forget the box. Mrs. Smith&mdash;unlike many
principals&mdash;approves of them&mdash;the reason you can guess&mdash;the <i>fact</i>
please mention to mother. In haste,</p>

<p class='author'><span class="smcap">Bessie</span>.'</p></div>


<p>It seems hardly consistent with my regard for the 'dear reader,' to add
any thing by way of remark on this true school-girl letter. But it is so
suggestive. How many circulars do tally with facts? Even in those of the
best schools, that need none of this clap-trap, there is a little
humbug. But this is rather the fault of the patrons; like Bessie's
mother, they will hardly look at a plain advertisement. The truth is, we
love to be humbugged. Among the 'wants of the age' may be classed
<i>humbug</i>.</p>

<p>I have read of a painter with disproportionately short legs, who, in all
his pictures of human figures&mdash;from Moses down to the Mayor, done in
heroic style&mdash;substituted his own legs. Your thorough utilitarian,
deficient in imagination, his idea of mental symmetry being his own
mental proportions, thinks no mind well balanced that has not a similar
deficiency. He is a believer in nothing but the real and the useful&mdash;all
else is stuff and nonsense; to him a mountain is a high elevation of
land; a plain, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> level tract; a forest, so much timber in a green
state; a cloud, a collection of vapor. He sees in every thing just what
there is in it and nothing more. Why does any one see more? It has been
a puzzle to me, the undefinable longing I have sometimes felt in looking
at a beautiful scene; a feeling akin to this, though lower, is that
awakened by the fragrance of some flowers&mdash;it is so unsatisfactory, you
wish to <i>taste</i> them. These somethings bring up a shadow of 'shadowy
recollections,' an echo of an echo of a past so indistinct, so dimly
distant, that it seems to have been a part of another life.</p>

<p>It may be that all earthly things are but types of spiritual things in a
future spiritual existence&mdash;hence the yearning; or they may be
expressions of spiritual things in a past spiritual existence&mdash;hence the
'shadowy recollections.' One thing is certain: all beauty and grandeur
are faint expressions of the ideas of the All-Father; therefore, O
utilitarian! you do wrong to ask of them: 'What use?' Better cultivate a
taste for them, and with this taste an earnest desire to look into that
Mind and read there thoughts of which Mont Blanc and the exquisite
flowers are but feeble utterances.</p>

<p>How the Great Teacher has lavished on us illustrations of his goodness,
as if he would in some way make it plain to all, '<i>what use</i>.' There
<i>must</i> be a use in every thing he creates. Every dew-drop that the
meanest weed has wooed and won from the atmosphere, is as tenderly cared
for by him, as the stream is that supplies your mill-pond; every briny
tear on the infant's cheek, as the ocean that bears on its bosom your
merchant-vessels. What use? Have not some things been made useless&mdash;in
your sense of the term&mdash;that they might be preserved from destruction?
The gorgeous-plumed birds, and brightly-enameled fish of the tropics,
are unfit for food&mdash;so, to your mind, of no use. I wonder if this holds
good in cannibal countries; if so, it would be no protection to poor
Molly O'Molly if she were there.</p>

<p>I, too, am a believer in the real and the useful; but to me, the sphere
of both is almost infinite. Are not the feelings awakened on viewing a
beautiful sunset, as real as your satisfaction after eating roast-beef?
Though I acknowledge that no one can thoroughly enjoy the one, who feels
the need of the other; if then weighed in the scale, the sunset would
'kick the beam.' All things 'by season seasoned are to their right
praise and true perfection.' It would, for instance, be rather out of
place to talk of the beauty of the stars to the houseless wanderer, for
whom there were no 'cheerful lights of home;' to expatiate on the
loveliness of the moon to him who must spend the chill night with no
other covering than her 'silver mantle.'... Moonlight and memory are
associated together in my mind&mdash;reflections of a set sun, wrapping in
their calm, beautiful light, all things, even the graves of those we
love.... I have thought that the murmur of the brook was the <i>voice of
Silence</i>. Moonlight expresses to the eye&mdash;<i>silence</i>.... 'All this
unreal?' I beg your pardon; I claim for my feelings the same reality
that you claim for yours. Is only what is gross real? Is not the sky as
real as the mountain that pierces it? Is there more reality in the chink
of the dollar than in 'the music of the spheres'? This first is, I
acknowledge, to me a pleasant sound, though only 'heard at rarest
intervals.'... Yet I am rather inclined to believe in the reality of
the music of the spheres; it is too ethereal, too spiritual a music for
the ear to <i>sense</i> it; the food and drink of the gods, ambrosia and
nectar, even were we to swallow them, could our mortal palates taste
them? Even thus may we drink in the music of the spheres, and, strange
as it may seem, the more <i>ear</i> we have, the less likely we will be to
hear it.</p>

<p>But&mdash;<i>not</i> 'in this connection,' in no connection&mdash;the utilitarian also
thoroughly despises cobweb theories, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> terms them. The world owes
its greatest achievements to theories&mdash;cobwebs they may be. In caves
have been found books of stone, whose nucleus was but cobweb; along
these webs the calcareous solution ran, and hardened into stone. A
cobweb theory has been the thread, on which, drop by drop, as it were,
experiments have run and hardened into a possibility on which might be
hung a <i>steam-boat</i>.</p>

<p>There goes the night-train. Every morning as the engine with its train
passes, the dark smoke rushing out of the chimney is touched by the rays
of the rising sun and made glorious. I doubt not my enjoyment in looking
at it is as real as that of the heaviest stockholder. Here I 'pitch my
foot against'&mdash;as Paley says in his famous watch-argument&mdash;<i>a
quotation</i>.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Life is transfigured in the soft and tender</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Light of love, as a volume dense</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of rolling smoke becomes a wreathed splendor</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the setting sun.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>But this warm subject of love I avoid as the whale avoids the warm water
of the Gulf Stream. So I will wheel about&mdash;first, one more digression:
This love, like the Gulf Stream, softens many a climate naturally as
cold as that of Labrador. I just throw out this hint for the sentimental
reader to enlarge upon.</p>

<p>That quotation from Alexander Smith reminds me of one other thing, for
which your utilitarian has a sovereign contempt&mdash;that is <i>poetry</i>. What
is poetry? Every thing that stirs the soul to its depths, or but crisps
the surface, is poetry&mdash;every truth does this, therefore every truth is
poetry. Mind, I don't say <i>conversely</i>, etc. There&mdash;that word
'conversely,' suggests to you that now you have me; there is
mathematical truth, you say; you might as well attempt to raise a tree
from cube-root as to attempt to make poetry sprout from mathematics....
Is there no poetry in the marked path of the vessel on the trackless
ocean&mdash;no poetry in the magnificent sweep of suns and worlds through
space&mdash;in the eccentric orbit of the faithful comet&mdash;faithful, for from
the most distant errands he passes right by earth, and even Venus,
lingers not a moment, but hastens back to his lord&mdash;is there no poetry
in the icing over of the brook, (if you think not, read Lowell's <i>Sir
Launfel</i>,) each icy crystal being an exact geometrical figure? When 'God
geometrizes,' he also poetizes.</p>

<p>Then if we can't say conversely all poetry is truth, yet poetry gives to
every thing she touches with her magic wand, the charm of reality. Are
not Ariel, Puck, Oberon, real characters, though but 'beings of the
mind'? Shylock and Lady Macbeth are to me as real as John Wesley and
Hannah More, and far more real than the dimly defined heroes of
Plutarch, except those that Shakspeare has thrilled with his own
life-blood&mdash;his very ghosts have an awful individuality&mdash;they are enough
to make you believe in ghosts. But hark! what was that&mdash;pshaw! it is
only a screech-owl on the maple near my window&mdash;Keats' 'owl, for all his
feathers, was a-cold,' I should think this was, from his shivering
notes. Listen again! how old is the dead Time, whose age the distant
town-clock is tolling? I don't care to count&mdash;to tell the truth, that
owl makes me nervous&mdash;and if it is 'the witching time of night,' I don't
care to know it&mdash;so good-night.</p>

<h2><a name="WOUNDED" id="WOUNDED"></a>WOUNDED</h2>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up the quiet street in the early Sunday morning, came with slow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">steps and silently, two wounded soldiers:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One with shattered arm and a cruel sabre-cut on his forehead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One with amputated leg, hobbled slowly along on crutches.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the thunder-storm and sharp crash of terrible battle, 'mid blood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">carnage, and death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comrades in arms, they fell side by side; one of them senseless, the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">other feeling his life-blood flowing away...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faintness came over him, breathing the sulphurous smoke, with the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">tornado of battle stunning his brain&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faintness&mdash;forgetfulness. A vision of childhood, of the sweet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Heaven-time of life, came to him...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He hoped it was death, coming as no king of terrors, but as a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">beautiful flower-crowned child,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bidding a hero welcome to the great halls of the laurel-wreathed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">dead&mdash;those who died for their country.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From this dream of the Future came sharp awaking to life; rattling</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">away in the ambulance...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crashing pains shooting wildly from leg to brains&mdash;the heart now and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">then grasped with steel fingers and squeezed...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The knife and the tourniquet, the rapid surgical operation: the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">poor, pale fellow maimed for life.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At home in a hospital kindly nursed and tended, hearing for the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">first time in life the name of God&mdash;not taken in vain: seeing the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">good <span class="smcap">deeds</span> of true woman...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knowing that should he die he would ask no gentler sounds to cheer</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">him on his road to the Hereafter, than the prayer he once heard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">read by The Lady in Gray to a dying soldier in the same</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">hospital:... thus passed he back again to life.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now convalescent he walks in the fresh morning up the quiet street,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">under the leafy shadow of lindens... he and his comrade in battle.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the faces of both you may see that they know how earnest is</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">life...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Angel of Death on the battle-field raised the veil of the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Future: transient the glimpse, but they will never forget it...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Angel of Mercy here in the hospital bound up their wounds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">cheering their hearts with kind looks and well-spoken words of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">true sympathy...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Solemnly earnest and beautiful is Life to these two wounded soldiers.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lame one is weary, and halts by the steps of a handsome house;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">his comrade with one arm helps him sit down there, on the lowest</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">step, leaning against the white marble balustrade.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through lace and silk curtains, from drawing-room window, looks down the street</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">a beautiful woman, waiting impatiently carriage, coachman, and footman,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">to carry her grandly to church.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up comes the carriage; wide open the doors of the house: Madame descends...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How is this?... She stops by the two wounded soldiers.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have two sons in the army, she thought; what if they were weary and wounded</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">like these?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then she speaks to the comrades in battle, and learning where they were going,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">insisted on their taking her carriage. She will have no refusal: and now</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">John the footman, inwardly groaning, assists the lame man to enter, then</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the other one takes a seat...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Off they whirl to their hospital-home, with a blessing upon the fair lady who dared</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">follow the teachings of <span class="smcap">One</span> whom that morning she worshiped with words ...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and with deeds.</span><br />
<br />

<h2><a name="ASTOR_AND_THE_CAPITALISTS_OF_NEW-YORK" id="ASTOR_AND_THE_CAPITALISTS_OF_NEW-YORK"></a>ASTOR AND THE CAPITALISTS OF NEW-YORK.</h2>


<p>The accumulation of wealth has always been a chief proclivity of our
race. The earliest of all books (Job) mentions it with sharp reproof, as
though even then it had become a theme with the moralist. In olden time,
wealth was even more unreliable than at the present day, especially as
the mere possession of gold was enough to endanger one's life. The
modern capitalist avoids this by devolving the custody of his cash on
some bank and holding its stock instead of a hoard of ingots. The
science of wealth now takes a more philosophic turn, and may be summed
up in one word, <i>debt</i>. To be rich is simply to have brought the
community in debt to yourself; and the greater it is, the greater, of
course, your riches. To be poor is simply to reverse this condition, and
to be in debt to others. The richest of all mankind may not have on
hand, in specie, at any one time, more than the amount of a single day's
income, and may be only able to show for his entire capital sundry
pieces of paper, representing value. This is a vast improvement upon
antiquity, since then wealth was identified with the holding of bullion,
for whose protection an especial deity was invented. By a strange
co&iuml;cidence, while Pluto was god of the lower regions, a slight change of
the name represented his moneyed colleague, and Plutus presided over
money. This connection is with sober wit hit off by Milton, who sets the
fallen angels at once to work digging gold.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">'Soon had his crew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Opened into the hills a spacious wound</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That riches grow in hell: that soil may best</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deserve the precious bane.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>The term 'almighty dollar' is stereotyped in modern slang, and yet the
idea could not but have existed under other words in the days of those
flush individuals, Midas and Cr&oelig;sus. The first of these moneyed
gentlemen found gold too plenty for comfort, while the latter, by his
unfortunate end, proved that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> even at that early time riches had learned
to fly away. Gold entered very largely into the politics of antiquity,
and by this means Crassus got a partnership in the grand triumvirate of
which Mark Antony and Octavius formed the more active parties. Poor
Crassus found, however, that to be a sleeping partner in a concern was
quite a dangerous position.</p>

<p>The danger in which money involves its possessor, is shown with dramatic
power by Scott, in his splendid medieval dream, <i>Ivanhoe</i>&mdash;in the
torture-scene, where the Jew is racked to obtain his gold. In connection
with this, it may be noted as a surprising fact that while poverty has
always been dreaded, it has ever been exempt from one term of peculiar
wretchedness. With all his privation, who ever heard a poor man
designated as a <i>miser</i>?</p>

<p>Wealth is a matter of comparison. The original term applied by the
New-England savages to the white was, <i>knifeman</i>; the possession of one
implement making the latter rich in the view of the Indian. What a vast
investment in wampum would such a weapon be? Carrying out the same
comparative idea, it is reported as one of John Jacob Astor's sayings:
'That a man worth fifty thousand dollars is as well off as though he was
rich.' So strong is this comparative aspect, that the money-hunter finds
his mark continually receding, and when he has attained his hundred
thousand, he is appalled by finding himself but a mere beginner compared
with others. He is but at the foot of the mountain which others have
climbed, and which towers above him in</p>

<p class='center'>
'Many a fiery, many a frozen Alp.'
</p>

<p>Hence, there is nothing more clearly proven in the psychology of man
than that accumulation utterly fails to fulfil the idea attached to
riches; that is, satiety or even satisfaction, and there is often a
bitter poverty of soul gnawing the owner of millions. The organic
thought crops out of great and small alike. It is said that the chief of
Boston merchants of the olden time, William Gray, when asked what would
satisfy him, replied, 'A little more;' while the Indian to whom the same
inquiry was made, replied with aboriginal simplicity: 'All the whisky
and all the tobacco in the world.' 'Nothing else?' added the inquirer.
'Yes,' replied the Indian in an anxious tone, 'a little more whisky.'
The same insatiable craving is shown in poor Isaac K&mdash;&mdash;, the
half-witted boy, whose droll sayings of a half-century ago are still
remembered about Boston. 'Father,' he one day exclaimed, 'I wish every
body was dead but you and me.' 'Why so, my son?' 'Why, then, father, you
and I would go out and buy all the world.'</p>

<p>The power of gold to inflict pain on its possessor suggests deep
philosophical inquiry. Even at a superficial view, one can not but be
struck by the fatal facility which it affords to vice on the one hand,
while on the other, how many suffer untold distress from the miser's
self-inflicted poverty? There are multitudes of ruined youth, who, had
they been bound to labor instead of being reared to a life of affluent
ease, would have become useful men. Indeed, by merely changing the
costume of Hogarth's <i>Rake's Progress</i>, we may see it enacted by scores
of young men in any of our leading cities. The writer once knew a
worn-out debauchee of thirty, who, even at that early age, had got rid
of an inheritance of a half-million.</p>

<p>The miseries of poverty are severe, and such men as Johnson and De
Quincey have painted them in colors drawn from their own experience; but
what scenes vastly more terrible might they not have sketched had they
held that master-key which unlocks the abodes of pleasure and summons
the dreadful crew of temptation?</p>

<p>One can not but pity the former of these, as he thinks of his wandering
the live-long night through the streets of London, unable to buy a
lodging, and eating each occasional meal, not knowing when he would get
another. Yet, had as this might have been, how vastly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> more pitiable
would his case have been, had he fulfilled the infernal career of some
of his rich cotemporaries, such as Lord Lyttelton or Lord Euston, whose
dying horrors Young has so thrillingly described in his <i>Altamont</i>.
Horace, who had so thoroughly studied the philosophy of life, could
refer to his lowly condition:</p>

<p class='center'>
'S&aelig;va paupertas et avitus apto<br />
Cum lare fundus:'
</p>

<p>and then cite the race reared in poverty as those who saved the
commonwealth, by defeating Hannibal. His deep-toned objurgations at the
degeneracy of Rome are brought to mind by the increased dissipation and
licentiousness of American youth.</p>

<p>Who can read lines like these without thinking of our concert-saloons
and other facilities of vice? (the former happily suppressed.)</p>

<p class='center'>
Damnasa quid non immmuit dies.
</p>

<p>The history of capitalists would be interesting, if only as showing this
single feature, namely, that the secret of great success lies in one's
placing himself in some channel where the stream must soon flow, and
thus anticipating the future.</p>

<p>Johnson, in the midst of his cheerless poverty, had some golden dreams,
was sensible of this fact, and illustrates it in one of those Oriental
apologues which occur in the <i>Rambler</i>, where he shows the tiny rivulet
gradually filling a lake. With the same idea permeating his mind, he
exclaims, when Thrale's brewery was to be sold: 'Here are the means of
wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.'</p>

<p>The history of rich men also proves that it is not so much the art of
getting as that of keeping which insures success. New-York and other of
our great cities contain thousands of poor men who, but a few years ago,
were heavy operators, and whose future seemed brilliant with promise.
Yet here they are, now struggling for mere bread.</p>

<p>Riches are winged creatures, which break cage with strange facility and
are not to be whistled back again. The array of agents, brokers,
book-keepers, and decayed gentlemen who but lately were numbered among
merchants, bankers, and ship-owners, is quite a moving spectacle. Thus
A. B&mdash;&mdash;, for thirty years connected with trade, during most of which
period he was a leading member of the great cloth house of&mdash;&mdash;, has been
worth two hundred thousand dollars, but is now a book-keeper for a
concern in John street. I. S&mdash;&mdash; has been forty years in trade, and was
considered successful beyond all liability to future risk; and for many
years ranked among the rich men of the street, but has since failed, and
is now poor. B&mdash;&mdash; and M&mdash;&mdash;, princes in the dry-goods line, built two
palatial stores in Broadway, have been immensely rich, but after
battling honorably with adverse fortune, have failed. J. R&mdash;&mdash;, a
retired merchant, estimated at five hundred thousand dollars, holding at
one time fifty thousand dollars in Delaware and Hudson Canal stock,
subsequently got involved and lost all. Instances like these might be
multiplied to volumes, but they are sufficient to illustrate the
transitory nature of earthly possessions.</p>

<p>The great capitalists of New-York are chiefly identified with its real
estate, and their wealth has generally arisen from its advance in value.
Few great fortunes have lasted long, when left to 'the caprices of
trade, and the sons of our merchant-princes generally turn out poor men.
The great estates of the city are of a very limited number, and are
mainly included in the names of Whitney, Goellet, Lorrillard,
Rhinelander, Stuyvesant, Lenox, and Astor. The first of these was so
long an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of Wall street, Front street, and Coenties Slip, that
even now, when wandering along those thoroughfares, we almost momently
expect to meet him. We can not but think that at the next turn we shall
see that shrunken and diminutive form, that meagre, hungry-looking
countenance, and that timid, nervous eye, which indicated the fear of
loss or the dread approach of charity. His office was held for years in
the second story of a ware<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>house in Front street, a spot in whose
vicinity he had passed nearly three-score years. Thither he had come in
his boyhood, a poor, friendless, New-Jersey lad, had found friends and
employment, had at last got to be a grocer, and had gradually
accumulated a large capital, by the closest economy. At this time the
war of 1812 broke out, and cotton became very low, in consequence of the
difficulty of shipping it to England. Mr. Whitney had at that time a
vast amount of outstanding accounts in the Southern States, and his
debtors were glad to pay him in this depreciated article. We have been
informed that Jackson's cotton defences of New-Orleans were of his
property. As neutral ships were permitted to sail between the
belligerent ports, Mr. Whitney exported large quantities of cotton to
England, and held the balance of his stock until the close of the war,
when it advanced enormously. This advance, together with the proceeds of
his exports, at once made him a millionaire, and the capital thus
acquired never lost a chance of increase. Giving up the details of
trade, Mr. Whitney bought large quantities of real estate, on which he
erected warehouses and obtained a princely rental. In addition to this,
he dealt more largely in commercial paper than any other man in the city
and perhaps in the Union. His habits of industry continued, and were a
theme of remark, as we observed him in his daily walk from his office to
the great moneyed centre of America, where the price of paper and money
rates regaled his ears. He was a good judge of paper, and needed no one
to advise him. He touched nothing but what in commercial parlance is
termed 'gilt-edged,' and of this he purchased almost daily for thirty
years. These notes being made payable to the order of the drawers,
needed no other indorsement, and hence might pass through an hundred
hands without this fact becoming known. Mr. Whitney's bills receivable
falling due in Wall street must have been at the rate of thirty thousand
dollars per day, and his purchases of paper, of course, were at about
the same rate. Much of this paper brought rates but little better than
interest, but on others from one to two per cent per month was obtained.
The secrets of this trade are deep and little understood, and few even
of the best dealers knew that when their notes had been given for
invoices of merchandise, they passed almost directly into the hands of a
few bill-buyers, and that perhaps in Stephen Whitney's portfolio might
be found almost the whole amount of good paper made in Front or South
streets. Mr. Kimball's recent work, <i>Undercurrents</i>, throws much light
on this traffic, and exhibits the result of deep study of our mercantile
system.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. Whitney's management of his estate soon brought him up to
an estimate of ten millions. I used not only to meet him daily at the
mart, but also attended the same church, (Dr. Alexander's.) He was a
regular attendant, and a close listener, and I used to marvel how he
could bear the plain truths that fell upon my ears. Here in the pulpit,
at least, was one who was no money-worshiper. How well we remember the
exclamation from that earnest preacher: 'Wealth! in comparison with this
thing, (religion,) let it not be mentioned!' Whitney was a great admirer
of plain preaching, though, we believe, he never got into the communion
of the Church. Both the preacher and his millionaire listener are now
dead, and the church has been pulled down, and the site is now covered
by a block of splendid stores. Mr. Whitney's charities were on a very
limited scale. When the congregation above referred to were building a
mission-house, he was applied to, to head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> the subscription, which he
did with a trifling sum. The gift was refused, and a larger one was
demanded, as in better keeping with his position. 'Sir,' was his reply,
'if you go on this way, there will not be a rich man left in the city of
New-York.' It is also said that on a certain occasion, he was called on
to aid a political movement with his subscription. 'Sir,' was his reply,
'I have no money to spare, but I'll come and sit up all night to fold
ballots for you.'</p>

<p>The Lorrillard estate was chiefly acquired through an immense tobacco
business which the patriarch of that house started nearly a century ago,
and which led to the purchase of large landed property. The original
identity of the name continues, and 'short cut' and 'ladies' twist' are
still sold under the sign and brand of the Lorrillards. We presume that
it is the oldest house in America.</p>

<p>The Stuyvesant farm was a vast but unprofitable tract of marshes in the
eastern part of New-York, but now covered by serried blocks, and among
the most densely populated portions of the city. Forty years ago, these
marshes were favorite skating-fields in winter, and here a lad was at
that time actually drowned by the breaking of the ice. Being out of
town, the drier portions were converted into an American Tyburn, and
here the murderer Johnson was hanged. Such were the Stuyvesant meadows,
whose worthless wastes have been raised to immense value by the growth
of the city.</p>

<p>Among those of our city capitalists who are more identified with general
benevolence, the names of Stuart and Lenox are chief. Messrs. Stuart are
two brothers, who are largely engaged in refining sugars, and who have
in this business made large sums. The concern originated in a small
shop, where, some fifty years ago, a Scotchwomen sold candy, with her
two boys as clerks. Instead of that little candy-shop, there stands on
the same spot an enormous refinery, whose operations employ hundreds of
hands, and whose purchases are by cargoes. What would the worthy mother
say to this transformation of her shop, as by some act of magic? But it
is the magic of industry and enterprise. The Stuarts use their wealth
with judicious liberality, and evidently mean that the world shall be
better for their living in it. Their contributions are large, and their
opportunities are great, for be it remembered, such men are under
incessant solicitation. Indeed, there are few things more fatal to one's
peace than a reputation for liberality, which lays one open to a siege
of begging faces and an inundation of begging letters, whose demands
would exhaust all resources. It is our opinion that, avoiding
ostentation on the one hand and importunity on the other, the Stuarts
contribute conscientiously to every worthy enterprise, in a proportion
corresponding to their profits.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The name of Lenox appears among some of the early Scotch emigrants, such
as the Irvings, Masons, Douglases, Grahams, etc. Robert Lenox became a
distinguished New-York merchant. His profits were wisely invested in
land, and this became very valuable. His only son, James, inherited the
larger portion of this estate, whose increasing value made him a
millionaire, and in its use, he has exhibited a remarkable benevolence.</p>

<p>We say <i>exhibited</i>, for though acting with studied secresy and silence,
his life has been so full of good works, that they can not be hid. In
these benefactions, Mr. Lenox exercises close discrimination, and for
this purpose has for years refused personal applications. This measure,
indeed, was necessary, in order to escape a perpetual siege, which would
soon have driven any man distracted. He has been in the habit of
considering written applications, and of selecting such as seemed worthy
of his patronage. Mr. Lenox annually disburses an enormous sum in a most
useful as well as most quiet manner. Indeed, his man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>sion is one of the
benevolent institutions of the day, and to all intents and purposes, its
occupant is but an actuary driven by perpetual duties and working with
assiduity to fulfil an important trust. He is a thoroughly practical
man, posted on all the details of business, and, inheriting the peculiar
abilities and energy of his father, puts them to the best of use.</p>

<p>We may say that the whole purpose of his life is benevolence to all
classes. Mr. Lenox will pardon us if we allude to his munificent gifts
toward educational enterprise, and especially to those which enrich the
institutions of Princeton. He has long been a trustee of Nassau Hall, in
whose behalf he has expended large sums, and whose gallery is enriched
with his portrait. The Theological Seminary is also an object of his
affectionate care. A few years ago, he observed that it needed increased
accommodation for its growing library. Carrying out a scheme which had
its inception in this circumstance, he quietly employed an architect to
draft plans, while at the same time a suitable range grounds was
obtained, the materials hauled from New-York, and the present noble
edifice, known as the Lenox Library, erected. That library has been of
vast assistance to the institution, and not a student visits its
alcoves, who does not gratefully remember its founder with a sentiment
like that uttered by Gray in reference to Eton:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Where grateful science still adores</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her Henry's sacred shade.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>We understand that it has been recently decided to change this structure
into an oratory, and to build another library, and we presume that in
this also Mr. Lenox takes the initiative. We have referred to the fact
that Mr. Lenox only considers written applications, but lest this
statement should lead to their increase, we would add a word of
explanation. Their number has already become so large as to create a
great burden, and the daily task of reading these his begging letters is
very annoying. Mr. Lenox is greatly overladen, and we advise any one who
may think of his name as a <i>dernier resort</i>, to refrain from adding to
the labors of an overworked philanthropist. Rest assured, dear reader,
that Mr. Lenox will do all possible good with his money, and if it fails
to reach you, it may flow to a more deserving object.</p>

<p>Mr. Lenox is deeply interested in the Free Church of Scotland, and was
one of its most efficient helpers at the time of its exodus. A
correspondence between him and De. Chalmers conveyed his benefactions
through the noblest of instrumentalities, and a portrait of the great
Scottish theologian graces the mansion of his American friend. It was
painted by Henry Inman, during his sojourn abroad, and is the finest
picture of Chalmers we have ever seen. Mr. Lenox is a man of fine taste,
and finds recreation in gathering rare books, of which he has a valuable
collection, and he possesses, in addition, a splendid gallery of
pictures. Among them are two of Turner's landscapes, and we know of no
others in America.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> We might say more of this estimable man, but will
not too soon anticipate the voice of fame. Our statements are made
mainly to correct some false impressions about one who, with all his
reticence, is one of the public men of his day, and who fulfills the
idea of the poet:</p>

<p class='center'>
'Do good by stealth and blush to find it fame.'
</p>

<p>Such a man was George Douglas, one of the same circle of wealthy
citizens of Scotch descent, who, though in a pecuniary view, hardly in
the same rank with Mr. Lenox, was still very rich. Mr. Douglas preserved
a studied retirement, and passed much of his time on his noble farm, but
was still active in philanthropy. His estate can not be far from a
half-million, yet it was used humbly in the service of his race.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Though nursed in greatness, and to riches born,</span><br />

</p>

<p>But among all American capitalists the name of Astor looms up in
unapproachable solitude, and stands as it has stood for nearly forty
years.</p>

<p>We may get the better idea of the Astor estate by a comparative view.
Thus, a man worth one hundred thousand dollars is a rich man; a man
worth five hundred thousand dollars is a very rich man; a millionaire is
still more the ideal of wealth. Mr. Astor, then, is, if rightly
estimated, equal to twenty-five millionaires, or two hundred and fifty
rich men of the class first mentioned. In the seven hundred thousand
inhabitants of New-York, there are not more than two hundred men worth
one hundred thousand dollars; not more than twenty-five of the second;
not more than ten of the last. Approaching the assessment-roll, we may
estimate the Astor estate at one thirtieth of the entire city. Thus he
stands one seven hundred thousandth in the proportion of population, and
one thirtieth in that of wealth; or in other words, he owns what would
be a fair proportion for twenty-five thousand of his fellow-citizens.
The commencement of this estate was, as is well known, by small
beginnings.</p>

<p>Among the emigrants who landed in New-York about the close of the French
Revolution, was a rude German, from Baden Baden, whose life in the New
World was commenced as a laborer. He afterward became a peddler of fancy
goods, and eventually a dealer in peltries. In 1791 there appeared at
Number 40 Little Dock street, the unpretending name of John Jacob Astor,
and here the foundation of his estate was laid. Astor soon took fair
rank among business men. He was prompt and snug in his dealing, honest
and straightforward, and beside this, carried great weight of character
in his countenance. No man could be much with him without being struck
with his depth of character, and the solidity of his views. At that time
the fur-trade was brisk along the Mohawk, and the peltries, after
passing through the hands of frontier dealers, generally found their way
into Astor's warehouse, in Liberty street. Here they were sorted with
great care by his own hands, and prepared for foreign markets. An
octogenarian merchant informed me that, calling once at Mr. Astor's
store, he found him in an upper loft clad in a long, coarse wrapper, and
engaged among his furs. 'I shall get for that,' said he, holding up the
skin of a splendid silver fox, 'forty dollars, in St. Petersburg.' It
probably cost him less than five dollars. Astor had no sooner gained a
position as a thrifty trader, than he took a higher step by induction
into Free-Masonry. We say a higher step, not with a view of glorifying
this institution, but because at that time it was exceedingly popular
and aristocratic, and gave tone to citizenship. Among the leading
Free-Masons of New-York were Peter Irving and his brother William,
Martin Hoffman, the founder of the great auction business, and father of
the late L. M. Hoffman. Moving among these magnates, John Jacob Astor
became Grand Treasurer. Mr. Astor had a brother of the same thrifty
turn, though not so successful in acquiring wealth. He was a butcher by
trade, and slaughtered himself into a pittance of one hundred thousand
dollars, which, as he died early, he bequeathed to William B., his
nephew. 'To him that hath shall be given.' Mr. Astor's oldest son is
said to have been a very promising lad, but his brain became injured by
a fall, and he soon fell into a state of derangement. A private asylum
was arranged for his use years ago, and this, with its grounds, covers
an entire block in the western part of the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Astor's profits rolled in upon him at a rate which no one could have
dreamed of, and he kept their amount a secret until he had so penetrated
the frontier by his agencies that he controlled the whole trade, when he
occa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>sionally acknowledged a degree of wealth which astonished those who
heard. For instance, we may state this fact in illustration: He had
occasion at a certain time to use a large amount of cash, and what was
very rare with him, applied to his bank for a heavy discount. The
unusual circumstance and the sum demanded startled the cashier, who in a
plain, business way, put the question: 'Mr. Astor, how much do you
consider yourself worth?' '<i>Not less than a million</i>,' was the reply. <i>A
million</i>! the cashier was overwhelmed. He supposed that he knew all his
customers, and had rated Astor at hardly more than one tenth of that
sum.</p>

<p>Mr. Astor commenced at an early day to buy real estate, and the habit
grew upon him until it became a passion. He was for years a leading
character at sheriff and other land sales, and it was the commonest
thing at such places to hear the closing words of the auctioneer: 'Last
call&mdash;going, going&mdash;gone&mdash;to John Jacob Astor.' At that time many large
estates were broken up, and among others, that of Aaron Burr was put
into the market, and speedily became the property of Mr. Astor. It
embraced a small suburban principality, whose mansion, 'Richmond Hill,'
was Burr's country-seat. The whole property is now in the heart of the
city and is worth millions, where once it brought thousands. Mr. Astor
boldly bought those wild lands, including swamps, rocky knolls, and
barren commons, which lay at waste from Canal street onward to
Bloomingdale, and while others affected to laugh at his judgment, the
correctness of that judgment is now quite apparent. A case similar in
character is that of the late eccentric Jonathan Hunt. This man, who had
accumulated a vast fortune South, was quite noted, a few years ago, for
his dashing land purchases in New-York, and his relatives actually
served on him a warrant <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i>, with a view of
preventing him from wasting his estate. Subsequently, however, it turned
out that these incessant purchases which had made him a leading man at
the Merchants' Exchange, and an object of distrust to his family, were
splendid operations. Poor Hunt's bid was subsequently refused by the
auctioneers, on the score of insanity, while the lots he bought on
Madison avenue and elsewhere, were, in fact, as speculations, superior
to the operations of the most sagacious speculators.</p>

<p>Astor's boldness increased with years. He bought government loans at a
time when other capitalists shrunk, and the price had run down to the
lowest mark. He bought claims against old estates&mdash;one of which paid an
enormous profit, and would have been accounted a splendid fortune of
itself&mdash;while the gradual increase of the city brought his waste lands
into demand; and the opening of the Erie Canal may be said to have at
one stroke added a million of dollars to the value of his estate.
Whatever was bought was held with determined grasp, however small the
prospect of advance. For instance, a friend of ours (now dead)
purchased, in company with Mr. Astor, two lots on Broadway, of which
they took separate deeds, and held for an advance. Year after year
passed by, but no advance appeared, while assessments were continually
made for city improvement. At the end of this period our friend called
on Mr. Astor and stated that he was weary of such long delay in getting
return for his investment, and asked him if he would not take the lot
and give him its simple cost. Mr. Astor calmly acceded to the proposal.
Had our friend held the same views as the great land operator, he would
have realized a fortune from this single lot, since what then cost one
thousand dollars is now worth fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The Napoleonic character of Mr. Astor's mind is shown by the great
commercial schemes which shared the claims of real estate. He was
extending the ramifications of his trade through the North-west
wilderness and competing with the Hudson Bay Company for the peltry
taken by the numerous tribes of savages, while at the same time a vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
export trade was carried on with Europe, and also with China, whence he
brought teas in exchange for furs. It was this broad ambition which
prompted the grand scheme of a new station at the mouth of the Columbia.
And this scheme, though it failed, was not without great national
results. Its misfortunes were chronicled by the pen of Irving, and in
his pages the story of the crew murdered, and the ship plundered and
burned, was recorded among the tragedies of commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. Astor lived to old age, and his life was one of few changes. From
his humble shop in Little Dock street (now Water street near Coenties
Slip) he removed his place of business to Liberty street, (Number 71,)
and subsequently to Broadway. His longest place of abode was Number 223
Broadway, now a part of the site of the Astor House, whence, after a
residence in Hoboken, he removed up-town to a block in Broadway near
Prince street. Here he remained until death, but he lived long enough to
see the progress of the city covering his lands with dwellings, and
bequeathed to his son the largest estate in America. Mr. Astor had a
literary taste, and was fond of book-men. He gave Fitz-Green Halleck a
snug and profitable clerkship, and on the death of the capitalist,
William B. Astor presented to the poet the sum of ten thousand dollars.
Mr. Astor also sought the acquaintance of Washington Irving on the
return of that distinguished gentleman from Europe, and it was at his
especial request that the <i>Astoria</i> was written. The friendship between
these two distinguished men continued until death, when it was found
that Mr. Irving had been appointed one of the executors of the will. The
fees connected with this office could not have been less than one
hundred thousand dollars, and the executors (six in number) at one time
received ten thousand dollars apiece.</p>

<p>Mr. Astor's project of the library was conceived long before his death,
and he had Dr. Cogswell for several years engaged in the collection of
books for this purpose. The full provisions, however, were not known
until the reading of the will developed the plan and funds. The plan was
not carried out in detail, but was left to the judgment of the trustees,
who modified it considerably, making an institution for reference
instead of a mere circulating library.</p>

<p>To the original bequest Mr. William B. Astor has since added a large
conveyance of real estate, and the institution is nearly double its
original size. Speaking of Mr. William B. Astor, we may be led to a few
references of a personal nature. As the ordinary street-passenger is
traversing Prince street, he is not likely to be struck by any of its
surroundings. The street itself is but of third-rate character, and the
houses are but of a common stamp. Near Broadway, however, one may notice
a small brick office, neatly built, of one story, with gable to the
street, but with doors and windows closed, and the whole appearance one
of security. Near the door may be seen a little sign which reads thus:
'Entrance next door: office hours from nine to three.' The next door, to
which we are referred, is a plain three-story brick dwelling, with no
name on the door, and might be taken for the residence of some
well-to-do old-fashioned family. Hence one is quite startled to find
that this is the headquarters of the chief capitalist of America.
Entering the street-door, one will find himself in a small vestibule,
neatly floored with checkered oil-cloth, and opening a door on his left,
he will enter a well-lighted front-room, destitute of any furniture but
a counting-house desk and a few chairs. At this desk stands an
accountant (or perhaps two) working at a set of books, and evidently
enjoying an easy berth. He will answer all ordinary inquiries, will do
the duty of refusing charitable demands, and will attend to any thing in
the ordinary run of business; but if one has any thing special on hand,
he will point to a door opening into a rear office. This apartment is of
moderate size and of simple furniture. On the table are a few books, and
on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> opening one of them, which appears well thumbed, it will be found to
contain maps of plots of city property, carefully and elegantly
executed, and embracing the boundaries of an enormous estate. Seated by
the table may generally be seen a stout-built man with large and
unattractive features, and upon the whole an ordinary face. He is
plainly dressed, and has a somewhat care-worn look, and appears to be
fifty or sixty years of age. One naturally feels (that is, if he be a
poor man) that it is quite a rare thing to address a capitalist, and
especially when that capitalist is the representative, say of
twenty-five millions of dollars. Such, at least, was our experience at
our first interview with William B. Astor.</p>

<p>Mr. Astor occupies an imposing mansion in Lafayette Place, and
immediately adjoining is the magnificent library to which we have
referred, and which should commemorate the name of the son as well as
that of the father. At this house he spends that small portion of his
time which is not occupied by his duties in Prince street, where he does
a full day's work (Sundays excepted) every day in the week. Thus the
daily routine of the richest man in America is a walk to and from home,
of a half-mile or so, and close attention to business.</p>

<p>The care of Mr. Astor's estate is a vast burden. His tenements of all
grades number several hundreds, ranging from the dwelling at three
hundred dollars per annum to the magnificent warehouse or hotel at
thirty thousand dollars. To relieve himself from the more vexatious
features of his business, he has committed his real estate collections
to an agent who does the work well, and who is, no doubt, largely paid.
He, with his clerks, collects rents, and makes returns of a rent-roll,
whose very recital would be wearisome. As a matter of course, such a man
must employ a small army of painters, carpenters, and other mechanics,
in order to keep up suitable repairs. As Mr. Astor pays no insurance,
the work of rebuilding after fires is in itself a large item.</p>

<p>A large part of Mr. Astor's property consists of vacant lots, which are
in continual demand, and which he generally prefers to hold rather than
sell; hence he is much employed with architects and master-builders, and
always has several blocks in course of erection. This is a very heavy
burden, and were it not for the help derived from his family, would, we
believe, crush him. However, his son, John Jacob, is quite a business
man, and bears his share of the load. This young gentleman has shown his
patriotism by serving in the army for the Union, in which he bears an
important commission. In addition to this, Mr. Astor has the aid of a
gentleman of business character and habits, once a member of one of the
largest shipping houses in the city, who has become connected with the
family by marriage. The labors of all these parties would not be more
than adequate to the task of collecting interest on bonds, looking after
dividends, etc., since that little fire-proof office in Prince street
contains several millions of Government and State securities.</p>

<p>In order to give something like an estimate of the immense income
rolling in upon this family, we must commence with the fact that two
dollars per day is considered fair wages for working men; that the man
who makes five dollars per day all the year round may be considered very
fortunate; that ten dollars per day is attained by that few who are more
favored and gifted, and whose proportion to the mass is about one to a
thousand. Starting from this estimate, we may be better prepared to rate
Mr. Astor's position by comparing any of the above sums with six
thousand dollars, which is said to be his daily income. Bless me! one
can not but exclaim; here Cr&oelig;sus himself might die with envy. Yet we
reply, after a moment's pause, let no one envy the man of gold. It is
said that when John Jacob Astor was once congratulated by a certain
person for his wealth, he replied by pointing to his pile of bonds, and
maps of property, at the same time in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>quiring: 'Would you like to manage
these matters for your board and clothes?' The man demurred to the idea.
'Sir,' continued the rich man, '<i>it is all that I get</i>!' Hence, thinking
on these things, we have never envied Mr. Astor, and would not bear the
burden of his wealth for all its glory. It is not the possession but the
use of money, which affords enjoyment, and this is a secret which the
rich seldom learn. Alas! among the annals of moneyed men, how seldom do
we meet a Stuart or a Lenox&mdash;men who have learned what Goldsmith calls
'the luxury of doing good.'</p>

<p>It is one of the peculiar misfortunes of the rich, to be subject to the
attentions of parasites and flatterers, and hence they can not possess
that same certainty of the value of friendship enjoyed by the poor. The
latter of these classes know that when a kind act is done to them, it
comes from a pure motive; the other seldom can be sure that it is not
from selfish ends. To illustrate the idea which wealth suggests, as to
the motive of friendly visitors, we may state that among Mr. Astor's
class-mates in Columbia College was a young man who became a preacher.
The students separated&mdash;the one to handle millions, and to touch the
springs of the money-market, and become the colossus of wealth; the
other to his flock, as a poor domestic missionary, whose history was
indeed a 'shady side.' The latter struggled on through thick and thin,
and never in all his privations thought of sending a begging-letter to
his old class-mate. But being once upon a time in New-York, he yielded
to the inclination to make him a visit. Mr. Astor received him
courteously, and the two conversed on the scenes of their early days. As
the pastor arose to depart, an idea struck the capitalist's heart, which
we mention to his credit. '<i>Can I do any thing for you</i>?' he inquired.
He had, in fact, misconceived the object of the visit, and supposed that
under the guise of a friendly call, lurked an inclination to beg, which
fear of refusal had suppressed. The poor clergyman at once perceived the
drift of the question. Nothing could have been farther from his mind,
and blushing at the thought, he acknowledged the suggestion with an
expression of gratitude, and retired.</p>

<p>Perhaps a view of the unrest of the human heart appears most terrible
when contrasted with the almost fabulous heaps of surrounding wealth,
and one is thus led to the conclusion arrived at by Goldsmith:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Vain, very vain, my weary search to find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bliss which only centres in the mind;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With secret course which no loud streams annoy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glides the smooth current of domestic joy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still to ourselves in every place consigned,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our own felicity we make or find.'</span><br />

<h4>SOME ACCOUNT OF JOEL BURNS OF BURNSVILLE</h4>

<p>You will find, as you travel through the country, but few very poor
people in New-England. Rarely are the 'selectmen' called to act either
on applications for admission as one of the 'town's poor,' or to 'bind
out' a boy or girl till one-and-twenty.</p>

<p>One evening&mdash;it was the close of a cold, raw day in the latter part of
November&mdash;the stage deposited a woman, and a lad perhaps twelve years
old, at the village tavern in Sudbury. She was intending to ride all
night; indeed, she had paid her 'fare' through to New-Haven, but, seized
with sudden illness, she was compelled to stop. Her malady proved to be
typhus fever. The doctor was summoned, who subjected his patient to the
terrific treatment then in vogue for that disorder, and in due course
she died. It turned out on inquiry, that the woman, whose name was
Burns, was on her way to a married sister's in Pennsylvania; further,
that she was a widow, the lad her only child, and the sister in
Pennsylvania the only near relation she had in the world. This sister
was by no means in affluent circumstances, but she could offer a home to
'Sarah,' which the latter was glad to accept. After disposing of the
trifling articles unsuitable to carry with her, she had barely money
enough to defray the expenses of herself and 'Joel' to their new abode.
The poor woman's journey was interrupted, as we have explained, at
Sudbury, and a new direction given to it. She departed for 'the
undiscovered country,' leaving little Joel to cry himself asleep; for
the time quite heart-broken, and desolate enough.</p>

<p>There was not time to write to the married sister; so the selectmen,
after ascertaining what money still remained in the purse of the
deceased, undertook the burial. They ordered a cheap pine coffin,
scantily 'stained.' It cost but a quarter of a dollar to dig the grave,
and old Sally agreed to 'lay the woman out' for the comfortable dress
she wore on arriving at the inn. Of the three selectmen of Sudbury, two
were from the east part of the town&mdash;thrifty, hard-working farmers; the
third was a Mr. Bellows, a popular store-keeper of the village. The
latter had not interfered with the action of his colleagues, because he
himself was very busy, and they, having very little to do at that
season, were pleased with the excitement the affair afforded them. But
passing the inn the morning Mrs. Burns was to be buried, Mr. Bellows
stepped in a moment at the request of the landlord, who was a
kind-hearted fellow, and did not feel quite satisfied with the
arrangements. Ascending to the chamber, he saw a sad but
handsome-looking boy standing over a rudely constructed coffin, a
picture of sorrow and despair. The little fellow had witnessed the
action of the coarse-hearted men who took the direction of the funeral.
He heard their private discussion as to the 'cost of burying the woman.'
He was a witness to their haggling with Aunt Sally about laying her out.
He could hear various propositions as to what was to be done with <i>him</i>.
He saw his mother hurriedly draped for the coffin and placed inside of
it. He did not sob nor cry; a dreadful reality had so overcome him, that
he lost the power of doing either. Once or twice, when every body had
left the room, he had stolen softly up and kissed the face of the
corpse, and some tears would then roll down his cheeks. It was at such a
time that Mr. Bellows entered, and his heart smote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> him that he had not
sooner looked in. He spoke kindly to Joel, which seemed to loose the
flood-gates of his grief, and for a time he continued to cry in the most
piteous manner. Mr. Bellows soon decided what to do. His own family was
small; he had a wife and one child&mdash;a little girl nine years old. He
took Joel in his lap, told him not to cry&mdash;that he should go home with
him, and be <i>his</i> boy. The tone in which this was uttered had more
effect to soothe the lad than what was said to him. After a few minutes,
Joel was persuaded to leave the room and to accompany his new friend to
the house. Mr. Bellows then called on his minister, and requested him to
perform the funeral rites at the grave; for so little interest had been
shown in the fate of the strange woman, that her illness had not even
been communicated to the clergyman, and the selectmen did not think it
'worth while to have any funeral'! Mr. Bellows hurried hack to the inn.
The coffin was placed in a wagon. It was followed by the clergyman and
Mr. Bellows, the two other selectmen, the landlord of the inn, and his
wife. The burying-ground was soon reached, a short prayer made, and the
company dispersed, leaving the man to fill up the grave according to
contract. Mr. Bellows and his two associates returned to the tavern
together, in order, as the latter expressed it, to settle up the
business. Going into the sitting-room, and taking seats around a small
table, one of them opened the subject in a serious and important tone,
indicative of the weight of responsibility he felt was resting on his
shoulders, by asking what was to be done with the boy.</p>

<p>'What do you think best to do with him?' said Mr. Bellows.</p>

<p>'Well, I suppose there is room in the town-house. There is nobody there
now but Aunt Lois and foolish Tom, and we can probably bind him out next
spring.'</p>

<p>'I don't think we have a right to charge the town with the expense,'
said selectman number two. 'We know where the boy came from; the best
way is to send him back to Granby.'</p>

<p>'He has got an aunt,' said the other; 'hadn't we better write to her?'</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' said Mr. Bellows, 'I will cut this matter short. I will
take the lad myself. You shall bind him out to me in the regular way. I
do not think you need fear any interference from the town of Granby. As
to his aunt, I propose first to write and get her consent. If she
prefers to take the boy, why, she will send for him.'</p>

<p>This question disposed of, the spokesman next proposed to go into the
accounts; which meant his own and his neighbor's charge for time and
personal expenses twice from East-Sudbury with horse and wagon. They
thought six dollars about right.</p>

<p>'How do you propose to be paid?' quoth Mr. Bellows.</p>

<p>'Twenty dollars and seventy-two cents was in their possession, taken
from the pocket of the woman after she died.'</p>

<p>'And how did you dare interfere with property of any kind,' exclaimed
Mr. Bellows, his smothered indignation bursting forth, 'without
consulting with me? Don't you know the landlord has the first claim on
every thing till his bill is paid? Don't you know, too, you are simply
doing the town business, and if you have any claim, the town must pay
you for it?'</p>

<p>Well, that is so, I guess,' said the third. 'It <i>is</i> agin the town. I'll
take my chances, for one&mdash;had rather settle it that way, any how.'</p>

<p>The result of the conference was, that the whole business, including the
twenty dollars and seventy-two cents, was handed over to Mr. Bellows,
leaving his colleagues to make out and collect their bill at leisure.
Joel's aunt was written to, and freely gave her consent that the boy
should go with his new friend. The latter promptly paid the bill at the
inn, and the doctor for his services, and soon after paid his colleagues
what they claimed, lest it might in the future be a subject of comment
when Joel grew up.</p>

<p>He was a good man, this Mr. Bellows;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> not specially refined in manner,
but possessing a delicacy of character and a lively sensibility which
placed him among the ranks of nature's noblemen. He had been fortunate
in business, and owned the principal store in the place, where he
exercised a decided influence.</p>

<p>Little Joel gave promise of not disappointing his patron's expectations.
In fact, he was a child of most engaging manners. His features were not
regular, nor indeed handsome; but he had bright black eyes, a fine
complexion, and an open, ingenuous countenance. He was treated by Mr.
Bellows as considerately as if he were his own son. To be sure, Joel had
some unpleasant scenes to pass through. As nothing is ever lost sight of
in a small country village, the story of how he came to be living with
Mr. Bellows was not forgotten. At school, occasionally, one of the boys
would, on some slight provocation, point at him and call him 'Bellows's
nigger,' or make faces and cry 'charity boy,' 'town's poor.' Now,
fortunately, Joel had a happy, joyous nature&mdash;somewhat fiery and
irascible, but still joyous&mdash;else he might have become morbidly
miserable. As it was, these manifestations only provoked his anger, and
led him forthwith into a rough-and-tumble fight, in which, whether
victor or not, he always showed unquestionable pluck. If he came off
second-best a dozen times, he went confidently into the thirteenth
trial, brave as Bruce, and equally successful. At length the voice of
gossip was hushed. Joel became the most popular lad in the village.
Every body liked him, and what is better, he deserved it.</p>

<p>But the evil days came at last to good Mr. Bellows&mdash;came after years of
happy, moderate, unclouded prosperity. First his wife died. This was
when Joel was twenty years old, and Ellen Bellows seventeen. The illness
was short, and the daughter was summoned from boarding-school in time
only to attend her mother's funeral. Mr. Bellows, after that, as every
body said, was an altered man. He could not bring his mind to business.
Some people thought at times he acted strangely, by which they meant he
was a little out of his head. Still, his affairs could not suffer while
such a young man as Joel Burns was about. The fact is, in some things
matters were even better managed than before. But great mistakes were
made in the purchase of goods, which Mr. Bellows continued to attend to,
and which Joel had too much respect for his benefactor to criticise. The
succeeding year, speculation in wool ran high. Mr. Bellows was anxious
to go into it. Joel took the freedom of begging him not to do so. The
latter appeared to be persuaded; but he did what was worse than engaging
actively in purchases, for then he would have had Joel's tact and energy
to aid him. He lent his name to an acquaintance, for a very large
amount, who was to go extensively into the scheme with him and divide
the profits. The result was disastrous. Wool fell rapidly. An attempt
was made to borrow money on it and hold it over to the next
season&mdash;worse and worse; Mr. Bellows was ruined.</p>

<p>One morning, very early, several attachments were levied on his goods,
and the store was shut up. One of the officers next proceeded to the
house and took possession there, so that Mr. Bellows was now tied hand
and foot.</p>

<p>I suppose few of my readers can appreciate what it is for a man to 'fail
up' in the country. In our large cities, it is regarded, to be sure, as
a misfortune, but one to which every merchant is exposed; and the usual
course is to propose a compromise, obtain a release, and set cheerfully
to work again, with loss of property, doubtless, but <i>not</i> with any
damage to reputation. But in the country, failure is regarded as a
disgrace, and a 'failed man' is looked and pointed at something as a
felon would be.</p>

<p>When Joel Burns awoke in the morning and found every thing in the hands
of the sheriff, he was astounded, for Mr. Bellows had not told him a
word about his last year's operations. He perceived the amounts were
larger than could ever be realized. He took in the whole situ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>ation at a
glance. He hastened to consult with Mr. Bellows, but he was listened to
with entire apathy. The merchant would say but little, and that was so
incoherent and unintelligible, it was evident he was laboring under
mental aberration. He continued moody through the day, and the next
morning was found dead in his bed. He had severed an artery.</p>

<p>At this time Joel was in his twenty-second year. Already displaying
extraordinary capacity in affairs, this event served to call out all his
resources.</p>

<p>I ought to have mentioned, before this, what every body will guess, that
Joel was desperately in love with Ellen Bellows, without, however,
giving her the least reason to believe so, beyond that silent,
unobtrusive devotion which girls, after all, are not very apt to
mistake. Joel felt that in his situation he had no right to attempt to
win Ellen's affection; but he unconsciously took the very best way to
win it. In his intercourse with her he was reserved, almost formal, and,
I may say, apparently indifferent. Ellen, when she came home from school
to spend her vacations, used to feel a good deal piqued that Joel was
not more demonstrative in his welcome. I can not believe she did not
comprehend pretty well how Joel really felt; but his manner annoyed her,
nevertheless. For example, he would frequently step aside and permit
another to wait on Miss Bellows, when Miss Bellows would much prefer
Joel had not been so accommodating. In fact, she was vexed with him half
the time for what she called his stupidity, and half the time tantalized
by his 'studious reserve.' Meanwhile, Joel pursued his career of
self-martyrdom, honest and true-hearted.</p>

<p>Now the scene had changed, and Joel was no longer the diffident youth,
but a man, competent and energetic. He took the direction of every
thing; nothing was overlooked. Of course the relatives were sent for. It
was the old story: they had paid great respect to their rich cousin, but
they did not seem to care much for the memory of the broken-down
insolvent.</p>

<p>The day of the funeral arrived&mdash;a dreary November day. It was just
eleven years from the day Joel's mother was buried and he himself taken
to the house of Mr. Bellows. Joel did not forget it, and it gave
additional strength to carry out what devolved on him. There was a very
large attendance at the house. The circumstances of the failure and
subsequent suicide, the situation of the only daughter, and the many
petty incidents which were now the town talk, excited the curiosity of
the good people, and there was an opportunity to gratify it by attending
the funeral. They wanted to see how the corpse would look. They were
crazy to know how Ellen Bellows would appear, and what Joel Burns would
do. So the house was thronged. After all, there was not much to satisfy
their curiosity. The corpse was not exposed; Ellen Bellows, contrary to
all custom in New-England, remained in her chamber, for which, as you
may believe, she was pretty thoroughly picked to pieces; and Joel Burns
sat quietly, with sad but tranquil countenance, among the mourners.</p>

<p>The next day Joel called Ellen aside and asked her whether she was not
going home with her aunt.</p>

<p>'Am I not to stay here?' she said.</p>

<p>Joel could not explain to her just then the absolute ruin which stared
her in the face. He simply answered: 'No, Ellen, you must go away for a
few weeks. There is much to do, and for a time you had better be
absent.'</p>

<p>'Very well, Joel, if you advise it. I have nobody else to advise me,'
and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>Joel remained calm. He had previously made up his mind just what to do,
and he brought all the energy of his nature to sustain him. His composed
air helped to restore Ellen&mdash;she tried to be as calm as he.</p>

<p>'But aunt, since she came, has not invited me return with her,' she
said.</p>

<p>'Oh! but she will, I am sure,' replied Joel, and he went out rather
abruptly;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> for here was an obstacle to his plan which did not occur to
him before. He proceeded at once to the aunt, and found her preparing to
leave that afternoon.</p>

<p>'You will take Ellen with you, I suppose?' he said.</p>

<p>'I am sure I had not thought of doing it. You know all the children are
home, and really we have no room at present.'</p>

<p>Two weeks previous she had written a pressing invitation to Ellen to
come at this particular time. Joel bluntly reminded her of it.</p>

<p>'Yes, but circumstances alter cases. The fact is, I can't afford to
maintain the girl, and I don't think I had better begin; and that's the
English of it, Joel, if you force me to say so. You know very well there
won't be a cent left.'</p>

<p>'I think I know more about that than you do,' replied Joel, with an air
which would have done credit to a <i>diplomat</i>, 'and, I assure you, Ellen
will <i>not</i> be left penniless; and if you will insist on her going with
you for a short time&mdash;mind, I say <i>insist</i>&mdash;I promise before long to
make certain disclosures which will satisfy you as to my assertion. But
she must not be here while they are settling up. You understand.'</p>

<p>The old lady did not understand, but Joel carried his point by the aid
of the mystery with which he surrounded it. It put her on her good
behavior at once, lest she should lose the promised revelation. She
spoke even affectionately to Ellen, and declared she should not let her
remain in the house alone, but she must go home with her.</p>

<p>Before the two left Sudbury, Joel had a very long interview with Ellen.
What passed at that interview never transpired, but the young girl's
countenance, though very sad, did not wear the desolate and despairing
expression which it exhibited before.</p>

<p>The stage now drew up, the ladies got in, and it rolled away, leaving
Joel and the deputy-sheriffs the sole possessors of the premises.</p>


<h3><a name="SUCCESSFUL_VI" id="SUCCESSFUL_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>


<p>A few miles to the north-east of Sudbury the country, at the time I
speak of it, had a wild and forbidding appearance. This was partly owing
to the immense forest which stretched along a continuous ridge of land
covering both sides of it and the plain below. On one side of this ridge
the face of the country was very rough; on the other side, through a
fine intervale, flowed a stream of respectable size called Pine Creek,
which took its rise in the mountains at some distance, and was fed by
innumerable springs and rivulets from the surrounding hills. Nearly a
thousand acres of these lands were owned by an old merchant in New-York,
who had taken them for debt many years before, and had become, as he
said, tired of paying taxes on them.</p>

<p>Joel had had his eye on the property for two or three years. What his
views were, we shall presently see, for no sooner did Miss Bellows quit
Sudbury with her aunt, than Joel, after remarking to the sheriff that he
did not propose to interfere with him in any way, proceeded to pack his
trunks, which he removed to the inn. Then he hired a horse and wagon for
a week, and set off no one knew whither. He came back within the time
limited, and found a committee of creditors awaiting his return. They
wanted to engage him to sell out the stock of goods and to close up Mr.
Bellows' affairs. Joel declined the service, although the offers were
liberal and coupled with the intimation that it would be the means of
starting him in business as the successor of Mr. Bellows. Joel
resolutely declined. He knew the estate was hopelessly insolvent, and
that he could not be of the least service to Ellen by any labors he
should undertake; and besides, he did not care to even appear to thrive
out of the broken fortunes of his patron. When still pressed by the now
perplexed creditors, he turned sharply on them and said: 'Gentlemen,
don't you think it would have been more judicious, not to say more
humane, had you waited on Mr. Bellows in his lifetime, and requested
<i>him</i> to undertake this service instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> of pouncing on his property,
closing his store, and hurrying him into his grave? He was an honest
man, and would have worked honestly for your benefit, and I would have
aided him. As it is, I do not feel disposed to lift a finger for you.
Good morning.'</p>

<p>Joel left the same day for New-York, and did not again return to
Sudbury. Some weeks afterward, in mid-winter, the report was circulated
that he was living in the woods on Pine Creek. Then the story went
abroad that the poor fellow was crazy and had turned hermit. This was
followed by other rumors still more ridiculous.</p>

<p>I have no desire to alarm the reader on Joel's account. It is time,
therefore, I should say that he had formed extensive plans for the
future, which he was proceeding to carry out. During his week's absence
he went carefully over the entire tract owned by the old merchant in
New-York. This lay on both sides of the creek, and extended to the
eastward quite over the 'ridge.' It was well timbered and beautifully
situated. After making these observations, Joel proceeded to New-York
and called on the proprietor. He stated his object to be to purchase a
hundred acres of the tract, for which he would pay five dollars an acre
cash. He wanted, besides, the refusal of the rest of the property, for a
certain time, at the same rate. The old merchant was pleased with Joel's
ingenuous manner as well as with his intelligence. He questioned him
minutely about the lands, for he had never seen them, and asked him what
he proposed to do with his purchase. Joel answered promptly and
truthfully. He put the owner in possession of every material fact.</p>

<p>'And all you will give is five dollars per acre?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Do you think that is all the lands are really worth?'</p>

<p>'I hope to make them worth much more to me, else I would not seek to
buy,' responded Joel. 'What they are worth to you, is for you to judge
after what I have said about them.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the old gentleman told Joel he would do better by him than he
asked. He would sell him the whole, receive the five hundred dollars,
and take back a mortgage for the balance. Joel would not accept this
proposition. He wanted one hundred acres, and he wanted to pay for them,
and the money was ready at five dollars the acre, and he desired the
refusal of the balance at the same rate. The bargain was closed in this
way, and Joel went on to his own property rejoicing. The plot selected
by him was from that portion nearest to the road, which here was about a
mile distant, and at a point of the stream most favorable for the
erection of a <i>saw-mill</i>. This hundred acres Joel had had carefully
surveyed before he went to New-York. It embraced a portion of the
'ridge,' with a front on the stream. The old village was miserably
situated, on the ancient principle of putting it in the centre of the
township, and a new road had been talked of for some time, which would
shorten the communication between two important points, and leave it to
one side. This was also known to Joel, and it led him to greater energy
in trying to secure the property. But he did not omit to mention this
circumstance in his interview with the proprietor, though, if the truth
be told, he was tempted to keep silent. Joel Burns had a fine moral
sense, to violate which, gave him pain. Without going through any
argument on the subject, he <i>felt</i> that it would amount to a deception
if he withheld the information.</p>

<p>At the time of Mr. Bellows' death Joel was worth about twelve hundred
dollars. His benefactor had not only paid him a full salary, but,
besides this, perceiving that Joel displayed an aptitude for business,
Mr. Bellows allowed him privileges by which he was able to make some
money on his own account. The result was, he had accumulated the sum I
have mentioned, from which had now been disbursed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> five hundred dollars
for the land purchase.</p>

<p>Through the winter Joel was very busy. He hired four stout, active
lumber-men, built a rude log-hut, which was comfortable enough inside,
and all set to work first to cut a road to the highway. Then they
commenced clearing. The timber was magnificent first-growth pine. It cut
up splendidly. The lumber-men now saw what Hiram was driving at. They
began to respect the young fellow who looked so much like a boy, yet who
showed such pluck, nerve, and sagacity. After a while, in a pleasant
position on the ridge could be seen a very neat log-house in progress of
erection. It contained four rooms&mdash;a spacious edifice for the woods&mdash;all
of course on the ground floor, for there was no second story. Great
attention was paid in a rude way to the interior, and by spring it was
finished.</p>

<p>During the winter Joel was twice absent from the 'settlement' for two or
three days. He was making a visit to&mdash;- Ellen's aunt. That worthy woman
had only been half-persuaded when she invited her niece home. Very soon,
she began to think she had made a mistake in 'harboring' her, especially
as the news spread abroad that Bellows' estate was a very great deal
worse than nothing. To be sure Joel's presence re&auml;ssured her, he looked
so competent, and spoke so confidently yet still so mysteriously. On his
second visit, however, the lady pretty flatly intimated she was losing
confidence in his assertions. She did not believe her brother had left
Ellen a cent in any shape.</p>

<p>'And I tell you what it is, Joel Burns, you need not think we are going
to support her. She must earn her living like other folks.'</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> will be responsible for Ellen's board,' said Joel indignantly. 'I
would have said that before, but I should feel mortified to have her
know I had made the offer, or you had accepted it.'</p>

<p>'You need not mount your high horse with me, Joel,' retorted the other,
but in a mollified tone. 'You know I am just as kind to Ellen as any
body would be under the circumstances.'</p>

<p>'As kind as Mr. Bellows would have been to Tilly and Eliza, had they
been left orphans, I suppose,' interrupted the still indignant Joel.</p>

<p>'Yes, to be sure. You don't imagine I should have expected him to take
care of my children!'</p>

<p>'But he would have done it though.'</p>

<p>'Well that may or may not be&mdash;he is dead and gone, poor man, and I have
done my best to make it pleasant for Ellen, and she will tell you so. We
have got along very well; I like her and her cousins like her, and I am
satisfied after what you have said.'</p>

<p>By the middle of April, the people of Sudbury had made up their minds
that Joel Burns was neither crazy nor exactly a hermit, nor yet a fool,
though some candidly admitted they had been fools when they so judged of
him. For by the middle of April a saw-mill with a double set of saws had
been put in operation, and was turning out the lumber rapidly. Quickly
the knowing ones saw into it, (but they did not see into it till Joel
had made his demonstration,) and now wondered why they had overlooked
the speculation. One very keen fellow determined to make the most out of
Joel's beginning. He examined the records at the office of the register
of deeds and discovered that Joel had title to but a hundred acres.
Thereupon he went to New-York with the object of purchasing the adjacent
lands. Imagine his chagrin, when he was told Joel had the refusal of the
whole tract. With a low cunning he endeavored to make the old merchant
dissatisfied with the sale, by telling him that he had parted with his
property for a quarter of its value&mdash;in fact, had given it away. He
would have offered twice the money himself.</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear you say so,' was the only reply the fellow received,
'for I take a great interest in that young man. So he has got his mill
a-going, has he? Good.'</p>

<p>'But if I should offer you ten dollars an acre for the next
hundred-acre-lot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> don't you think you could manage to let me have it?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>What an excitement there was when our smart man returned and gave an
account of his trip. Then followed all sorts of rumors. Joel was in
partnership with a rich old fellow in 'York,' who was going to let him
have all the money he wanted. There was to be a new village right away,
situated somewhere&mdash;on the ridge&mdash;on the stream&mdash;across the creek&mdash;on
the plain&mdash;under the hill. What wouldn't the speculators give to know
<i>just</i> where! With the erection of the saw-mill, several little huts
went up near it for the use of those employed there. These huts were not
made of logs&mdash;there was plenty of lumber now&mdash;but cheaply constructed
and clap-boarded with slabs. Some of the Sudbury wits derisively called
the place 'Slab City.' The lumber-men seemed to like this name, for they
at once adopted it, and it has never been known by any other.</p>

<p>But before this, a remarkable event occurred, affording still greater
food for town-talk and gossip generally. The neat log-house on the ridge
had been comfortably furnished, and Ellen Bellows&mdash;now Ellen
Burns&mdash;installed as its mistress.</p>

<p>On his third visit the mystery was solved in a manner quite satisfactory
to the aunt. To do that lady justice, we must say she was not half so
selfish nor so calculating as she might have been. It is true she had
not generosity enough to run the risk of offering Ellen a home as long
as she might require one, whatever should happen. But she was tolerably
kind to her, and when she heard that a wedding was to be speedily
improvised, she entered into it heart and soul, and made every thing
pass pleasantly, yes, happily. Furthermore, I am bound to record that
she refused to take one penny for Ellen's 'board,' although Joel pressed
her to do so.</p>

<p>'Do you think I am an old hunks, Joel, because I did not feel able to
undertake Ellen's support? Prudent I try to be, it is my duty. Haven't I
my own children to look after? but because I <i>am</i> prudent and do my
duty, can't I show some kindness to my poor brother's only child? Don't
talk to me about 'board,' and, Joel, don't say any thing to Ellen about
our previous conversation. You know I have always been perfectly
satisfied with every thing you told me.'</p>

<p>Joel felt too happy then to question the fact, if indeed, it could be
questioned. He re&auml;ssured the good woman on that head, and added he
should in due time expect visits from Tilly and Eliza.</p>

<p>'They will be delighted to go, and what is more Mr. Barron (her husband)
has been thinking a good deal of leaving here, and I should not be
surprised if he paid you a visit one of these days to see what chances
offer, for we have all heard how smart <i>you</i> have been.'</p>

<p>It is essential I should explain to the reader why Joel Burns, who was
ingenuous and truthful, and by no means fond of mystery or concealment,
should make use of both in his intercourse with Ellen's aunt. We have
previously stated how desperately he was in love with Ellen, and further
how hard he tried to make himself believe his affection could never be
reciprocated. When, however, the day of trial came suddenly on <i>her</i>,
all the nonsense was scattered from Joel's brain like mist before the
wind. But the romance in his heart was not dissipated, because romance
is <i>not</i> nonsense. Genuine romance is a real element in our natures, and
so long as we preserve it, we are young. When Joel found himself placed
in the position of Ellen's sole protector, he took prompt and decisive
steps <i>for</i> her protection. But while he hoped to win her for his wife,
he could not endure the thought that possibly a part of his success
might be due to the change in Ellen's fortunes, or that her choice
should not be free and unrestrained. It was for this reason he mystified
the aunt and procured for Ellen a cordial invitation to stay with her
'till the business matters were settled,' thus mystifying Ellen also.
She, poor girl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> continued in happy ignorance of her absolutely
destitute condition. She loved Joel dearly, and it was one of her
happiest day-dreams to plan how she could aid him in his projects by
putting him in possession of all she should have&mdash;yes, all.</p>

<p>The evening before the wedding, after Joel had given a full history of
the progress of the 'settlement' and what he hoped to do in the future,
Ellen, overcoming the timidity which had before prevented her speaking,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'O Joel! how much you have done&mdash;all alone, too! When you get what is
coming to me, won't <i>that</i> help you? and you shall have the whole of it,
dear Joel, every dollar!'</p>

<p>She stopped and blushed, half-frightened at her boldness. Tears came
into Joel's eyes, he was so happy. He threw his arms around his beloved
and pressed her to his heart.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>People could now understand where the village was to be. The new road
had been laid out and was in course of construction. It passed along the
ridge near the centre. On computing the distances, it was found this
point would be a convenient one for a stage-house, where passengers
could pass the night. Joel sold to the stage company what lots they
required, at a very low price, on condition that they would erect a
first-rate public house. The water-power at 'Slab City,' three fourths
of a mile distant, attracted attention. The 'fell' was large, and the
supply of water abundant. One man started with a turning-machine, which
was attached to the mill. Another, with more capital, established a
fulling-mill, and so on. Joel avoided the ordinary errors of
landholders. He did not attempt to carry on all sorts of business
himself, neither did he hold his lots at too high prices. To actual
settlers he sold very cheap; to speculators he would not sell at all.
The old merchant continued his friend. By his recommendation a man with
considerable capital visited the place, and being well pleased,
purchased some of the water-power and built a large button-factory,
Joel's views proved most judicious. By laying out the village on the
ridge, he secured a beautiful site, which was relieved from a close
proximity to shops and mills and factories, while it had really the
support of all these. Several fine houses were now erected. Two stores
were started, and a meeting-house built, for which Joel gave nearly all
the lumber. Next a post-office was established, and the place called
Burnsville. It was a beautiful spot, and how it grew and flourished! But
Burnsville would have amounted to little had it not been for Slab City.
Joel took care not to lose an opportunity for strengthening <i>it</i>.
Water-power could always be had of him cheap. I forgot to say he erected
a 'grist-mill,' which was much needed. Two other saw-mills beside his
own were built a little way further up, but on his tract. Mr. Barron and
family did move to Burnsville, as Mrs. B. intimated they might. He
brought a good deal of money with him, and turned his enterprise to
account. The families continued intimate. In ten years Burnsville became
one of the most prosperous villages in the State. Joel Burns was a rich
man, as well as <i>the</i> man of the place. These ten years had wrought no
great changes in Joel's character or habits. To be sure he had become
more engrossed in plans for future operations. By degrees he had
narrowed his mind into the channel of <i>successful effort</i>. The
circumference of his existence was probably more limited than when he
brought his little wife into the pretty log-house on the ridge. (He now
lived in the handsomest one in the village.) Still, he was more active,
more perseveringly energetic, more effective than ever before. But the
romance of which I spoke had faded, or was overshadowed, by the forms of
active, busy, bustling life. Still Joel Burns was in the main the same
ingenuous, honest-hearted fellow as ever. A happy man&mdash;happy in his
home&mdash;happy because prosperous in his business&mdash;but by no means as happy
as he might have been.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> Regarding him in this view, it was melancholy to
see him so utterly engrossed in his pursuits and plans. He did not take
time to look about him and enjoy. The Sabbath to him was a dull,
wearisome, restless day. He had too much respect for it to desecrate it
by even a private attention to his affairs, and he had very little idea
of any spiritual wants. He was active in erecting a church and securing
a good preacher, on whose ministrations he attended regularly with his
family. Yet it was a great relief to him when Sunday was over, and he
welcomed the succeeding morning with a renewed zest.</p>

<p>Joel Burns became a very popular man; he was universally beloved; he was
generous and public-spirited. He was unselfish in his ordinary dealings,
and always ready to lend a helping hand to those about him. His success
was not owing to a close, hard, grasping nature, but was the result of
fine business abilities, coupled with extraordinary energy and
perseverance.</p>

<p>Joel Burns was unjust to no one but himself. He neglected to cultivate
his moral nature, and left it in danger of being choked by the cares he
voluntarily assumed. He had one safeguard, however. I have observed that
he was happy in his family. This consisted of his wife, and one child&mdash;a
daughter named Sarah, after Joel's mother. When with them, Joel <i>did</i>
forget his business life. His love for his wife and child was like a
gushing fountain of pure water. It preserved his heart from becoming
arid, and his nature from ossification.</p>

<p>Twelve years passed, and found Burnsville more nourishing than ever, and
Joel Burns yet without any interruption to his fortunes or his
happiness.</p>

<p>Late in summer, typhus fever&mdash;a dreadful visitor in this part of
New-England&mdash;made its appearance, and became more prevalent than usual,
and assumed a severer type. Mrs. Burns was among the first attacked, and
with great severity.</p>

<p>Joel felt the foundations of his soul giving way when the possibility
presented itself that his wife <i>might</i> die. He called to mind with a
shudder the scene at the village tavern in Sudbury, when, a child, he
stood by his mother's bedside and heard, awe-struck, her incoherent
ravings while the delirium of fever was on her. 'O my God! she will die,
she will die!' he exclaimed, as he rushed out of the room, unable to
control his feelings.</p>

<p>The country was scoured for doctors. An eminent medical man from
New-Haven was sent for. He was unable to come; but the house was filled
with consulting physicians. Alas I they knew little in those days how to
treat this terrible malady, or rather how to skillfully let it alone.
Day after day, Joel paced up and down, now in this room, now in that,
all over the house. At night he watched by his wife. He insisted on
doing so; no argument or entreaty could prevail on him to leave her a
moment. She was delirious nearly all the time. Then her voice would be
strong, her eyes glassy bright, her cheeks flushed and burning. She
recognized neither husband nor child.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was in the middle of the night. The 'watcher' who sat up in company
with Joel, slumbered in his chair. He did not slumber, but sat with eyes
fixed on his wife, who for some time seemed to be resting easier than
before. Presently her lips moved. Her husband bent over her.</p>

<p>'Joel.'</p>

<p>'I am here, my darling.'</p>

<p>'Joel.'</p>

<p>'Yes, dearest.'</p>

<p>'We have not lived right'</p>

<p>'No, dear.'</p>

<p>'You do not think we have lived right, do you?'</p>

<p>'No, oh! no.'</p>

<p>'I am going to die, Joel.'</p>

<p>'Do not speak in that way!' and the poor fellow groaned, in spite of
every effort to control himself.</p>

<p>'I must, Joel, I must. We have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> lived right <i>You</i> will live right
when I am gone. You will teach Sarah to live right, won't you?'</p>

<p>'I don't want to live at all if you do not live!' was the passionate
answer.</p>

<p>'For our child's sake, Joel.'</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>'What a kind, loving husband you have been to me&mdash;been to me always! I
loved you&mdash;loved you before you knew it, Joel.' Here she opened her eyes
languidly, and essayed to turn them on him. 'But we have not lived
right.'</p>

<p>There was still no response, save by audible sobs.</p>

<p>'I think I have made my peace with God. Are you glad, Joel?'</p>

<p>'Now I don't care what happens, if you only feel happy!' he cried. 'But
to have you die in distress of mind! It would drive me crazy.'</p>

<p>'Give God the praise, Joel. I <i>am</i> happy. It is so sweet to trust in
Him! You won't neglect&mdash;neglect&mdash;you won't&mdash;&mdash;' She fell into a stupor,
from which she never fully awoke. Although she lived another day, she
exhibited no signs of consciousness. Joel fancied that she was aware of
his presence; but she never spoke again.</p>

<p>The funeral was attended by a large concourse of people&mdash;very different
from that of Joel's mother, whom three selectmen followed to the grave.
When it was over, Joel and his daughter went back to their desolate
house, while the village set to work to speculate as to whom the widower
would marry. '<i>Such</i> a match! <i>So</i> rich, and only one child! Emily Parks
would make him a good wife; only Emily was rather old&mdash;at least
twenty-seven or eight&mdash;and Mr. Burns would marry a young girl, of
course. Why shouldn't he, with the amount of money he had? He might take
a fancy to Julia Davis&mdash;she had just left school.' 'Why shouldn't he
marry Lizzie?' said Mrs. Barron to herself. And Lizzie was sent over
that very day to 'see to things' for Mr. Burns.</p>

<p>His trials were not ended. Sarah, who was now in her twelfth year, was
taken ill the following week. The fever was no doubt going through the
family, said the doctors. Joel's faith in medical men was a good deal
shaken, but he had to call them in, and Sarah grew worse. Three weeks
she lay, submitting to the old treatment, waiting for the 'crisis.' Joel
could endure it no longer. He started for New-Haven, changing horses
every ten miles. He found the doctor he went in quest of at home; but he
said it was impossible for him to go.</p>

<p>'I have lost my wife, and shall lose my child,' said Joel Burns
hoarsely.</p>

<p>'My friend,' said the doctor in a mild tone, 'people are dying every
where. I have my own patients, whom I ought not to neglect.'</p>

<p>'Go with me, I, implore you,' urged the despairing man; 'I have relays
of horses, and I will drive ten miles an hour.' Joel's importunity
prevailed. The distance was accomplished in a marvelously brief time.</p>

<p>It was a hot, sultry day, the second week of September, about noon, when
Joel, accompanied by the doctor, entered the sick-room.</p>

<p>'How is Sarah?'</p>

<p>'No better,' whispered Miss Barron, who had remained in the house. 'The
doctor left half an hour ago. He says he thinks she will go as her
mother went.'</p>

<p>'I am awake, father!' (He had approached the bed very carefully, so as
not to disturb her.) 'It seems a great while since you went away.'</p>

<p>'I have brought a doctor to cure you, my child,' said Joel. He knew the
value of hope and confidence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the physician was glancing around the room. As I have said, it
was a close, sultry day; but the windows were all closed, so that not a
breath of air could circulate through the apartment. The doctor quietly
threw up every one of them. Perceiving a cot standing near, he ordered
it made up with fresh sheets. Going to the bedside of his little
patient: 'How do you feel, my child?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I don't know.'</p>

<p>'Bring me a bowl of water and a soft napkin.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>'Warm water, I suppose?' said the nurse.</p>

<p>'Cold.' He threw off the heavy blanket from the bed, and unbuttoning the
night-dress, which came close around her, he bathed the child's face and
neck with the grateful fluid.</p>

<p>'You feel better now?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Don't you want any thing, my dear?'</p>

<p>'I want some water.'</p>

<p>'Give her water, nurse,' said the doctor.</p>

<p>The woman stared in utter amazement. If she had been ordered to cut the
child's throat, she could not have been more astounded.</p>

<p>'I say, bring a tumbler of water.'</p>

<p>This was done, and the nurse offered the patient a few drops in a
tea-spoon.</p>

<p>'Give me the glass,' and he took it out of her hand. Tenderly he raised
the sick child to a comfortable position, and placed it to her lips.
'Take as much as you like, my dear. Water was made to drink.'</p>

<p>He now directed a complete and speedy change of garments, and then he
himself took Sarah in his arms and laid her on the other bed. In fifteen
minutes, she was sleeping, while a gentle perspiration showed the crisis
had passed. Joel Burns stood still, regarding the doctor as he would a
being from another world. When he saw him doing just what was invariably
prohibited, doing it with such an air of decision and self-confidence
yet with no peculiar ostentation, he felt it would all be right. The
nurse, at first, was in very bad humor; but nobody noticed her, so she
concluded it was best to be good-natured and obey orders. The next day,
the doctor pronounced little Sarah out of danger, provided she was
properly nursed, and after leaving special directions, which he charged
Joel to see to personally till he could hear from him, he returned home
as rapidly as he came. When the man who accompanied him came back, he
brought the doctor's favorite student, who had directions to devote
himself to the 'case,' in which the doctor took so strong an interest.
The good man had another motive. He believed the fever was about to
attack Joel, and he determined to exert his skill to save him, if
possible. To have advised him of his fears, would have been injudicious.
He therefore dispatched a young man in whom he had great confidence,
after giving him minute instructions. Little Sarah, watched and tended
with great care, grew rapidly better. But when the excitement produced
by the scenes through which Joel had passed was at an end, a great
reaction took place, which left him in a very weak state. In that
condition, he was seized by the terrible malady, which found a fit
subject in his weakened frame and broken spirits. For weeks Joel Burns
lay balancing between life and death. It seemed as if a feather's weight
on either side would turn the scale. Morning after morning, the question
was put by the whole village: 'Is Mr. Burns alive?' Twice, on occasions
which seemed specially urgent, did our worthy doctor come from
New-Haven, spend a few hours, and return. The medical student kept his
post manfully. It was something to go counter to the opinions and
judgments of all the physicians about, far and near. Especially when, if
the patient should die, the voice of authority would proclaim that a
murder had been committed. [Now, it would be considered murder to follow
the old method.] But the doctor was firm, his pupil an enthusiastic
believer in his master's genius, and the course was persisted in. At
length, the daily reports were modified. First, Mr. Burns was 'no
worse.' After that, he was 'a little more comfortable.' Then came the
announcement that he was 'better.' The medical men round about were
excessively chagrined; but every body else rejoiced at the good news.</p>

<p>All this time, what of Joel Burns? How did he do? Not what was the
history of his physical malady. But what was his state morally,
mentally, religiously before God! Recollect, the man had never had a
check in his whole ca<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>reer before. The circumstances of his childhood
served rather to give strength and firmness to his nature. The sudden
failure and death of his benefactor only threw him the more on his own
resources, with which he was amply provided. His plans had been
successful. His friends were many. His hopes for the future were large,
yet not unreasonable; while on all sides, as we have said, he was
regarded as <i>the</i> man of the community in which he lived.</p>

<p>Joel had scarcely time for reflection, after the death of his wife,
before his child was taken ill, and ere she was really out of danger, he
himself was stricken down. All that long, weary time, during days and
nights of fever and delirium, of exhaustion and weakness, of
convalescence and recovery, the whisper of his dying wife was constantly
heard:</p>

<p>'Joel, we have not lived right! Do you think we have lived right, Joel?'</p>

<p>'<i>Lived right</i>!' What did that mean? Was Joel Burns a dishonest man? Was
he not kind-hearted, generous, loving toward his wife, affectionate to
his child, charitable and public-spirited?</p>

<p>'<i>Lived right</i>.' Joel had answered his wife instantly, not daring then
and there to soothe her by equivocation, but replying truthfully out of
his soul: 'No, oh! no.' What did he mean by that? Of what did he stand
convicted, and wherefore? These were the thoughts which occupied his
mind, especially after the fever had left him, during the long weeks of
his recovery. Joel was a man of extraordinary perceptive faculties. The
situation in which he had been placed, the remarkable health which he
had enjoyed, (for he had never been ill in his life,) and the success
which had attended every plan and effort, served to still more develop
all his practical talents, and were at the same time unfavorable to
reflection or serious thought. Now he could do nothing else but reflect
and think. He looked about him. His wife was gone, and his happiness
wrecked. What was he to do? Should he make haste to push on the schemes
which his sickness had brought to a stand? The idea was loathsome to
him. He had seen how completely they were liable to interruption and
blight. The thought of his daughter was the only comfort left, but she
might be taken&mdash;then <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>Ah! Joel Burns! how long and wide you searched to answer that question
when the answer was so near at hand and so easy to discover. He did
discover it at last. His wife, with her latest breath, had given him the
clue. He examined himself more carefully. What are the relations between
me and my Maker? Do I recognize any?... When Joel Burns rose from his
sick-bed and could walk abroad, all things wore to him a new and pleased
aspect. The current of his hopes were changed. He no longer revolved
around himself as a centre. He was conscious of his error before God,
and sought and found 'peace in believing.' He now regarded all things in
the light of His providence and felt submissive to His will.</p>

<p>Joel was no longer indifferent to his affairs. There was so much he
could do to benefit every body. What a happy feeling to try to be
working out good for some body all the time! When, however, he was able
actively to engage in business, there was very little difference between
his course of action and in what he did and his old course and what he
used to do. The fact is, Joel <i>did</i> about what was right before. We have
already related that he was kind, charitable, generous, and
public-spirited. The difference, however, was, that Joel <i>himself</i> was
changed. The <i>springs</i> of life and conduct were new: this is why he
seemed to himself to be living so differently. And he <i>was</i> living
differently. There was no similitude between the Joel Burns who,
impelled by an active brain and an energetic purpose, was successfully
prosecuting certain plans with reference solely <i>to</i> those plans, and
the Joel Burns who had learned to feel that the chief <i>object</i> of
existence lay above and beyond, and was centred in the Omnipotent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Sarah recovered rapidly from the fever, and before her father was
himself convalescent the bloom of health had returned to her cheeks.
Joel's love for his child was increased ten-fold. She became, as she
grew up, an inseparable companion. It was evident he had no thoughts of
marrying. The people of the village decided <i>that</i> at the end of a year.
The widower gave none of the ordinary tokens that he was seeking a new
wife, that is, he did not 'brush up' any, and took no special pains with
his personal appearance, but went about much as usual. It was a great
pity, every body said, for a man as young as he&mdash;hardly
three-and-thirty&mdash;to live without a wife. Sarah required a motherly care
over her, her father was spoiling her. Yes, it was a great pity Mr.
Burns did not marry. The fact was, strange as it will seem, Joel could
not forget his wife, though she was dead. A sweet and solemn link bound
him to her since the night he stood over her to catch her last words,
and it would appear his affections were not to be diverted from her
memory. He did not send Sarah away to school. He could not reconcile
himself to her absence, but he supplied her abundantly with teachers,
and personally took great pains with her education.</p>

<p>Two years after the death of Mrs. Burns, Joel and his daughter stood up
together before the assembled church and congregation, and made a public
profession of religion. It was a touching sight. And when after the
services father and child took their way homeward, every eye followed
them with looks of deepest interest and with feelings of almost
universal kindness and regard. Joel had delayed presenting himself from
a desire to test his feelings, having great fear of bringing reproach on
the church by entering it unworthily. And now he had an increased joy
that he could bring his darling into the fold with him.</p>

<p>It was very natural, as she was situated, that Sarah should acquire an
accurate knowledge of her father's affairs. She enjoyed listening to the
story of his early life, the rise and progress of Burnsville, with
explanations of his many undertakings. As she grew older, this interest
took a more practical turn. She would copy letters and arrange
confidential papers, and perform various services of a like nature.</p>

<p>Two or three years more passed. Things went on as usual, at Burnsville.
It is true that Joel Burns did not display that sharp faculty of
acquisition which he formerly did, though he was never more active or
energetic; but it was noticeable that those in his employ got on better
than before, while the general prosperity of the village exceeded that
of any former period.</p>

<p>Sarah was almost a young lady. She was growing up a beautiful girl. She
had her father's brilliant complexion and her mother's fine form and
regular features. Of course, with so much youth and beauty, and such
'brilliant prospects,' (by which, I suppose, was meant her father's
death and a large fortune to the child,) Sarah already became an object
of much attention. I will not say that her peculiar position did not
produce something of an independent manner which some called hauteur,
and others exclusiveness. Part of this was owing to her education, part
to the necessity of repelling sometimes the advances of conceited
coxcombs. But she was really a most interesting girl, with much of her
father's spirit, resolution, and ability. Her affection for him was only
exceeded by his for her. True, their lives were centred in each other
too much. But it was very beautiful to behold.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of Burnsville, and such the situation of Joel
Burns, when Hiram Meeker sought to remove to that place and enter his
service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a dingy old sign. It has hung there in sun and rain till its
letters are faint and its face is furrowed. It has looked down on a
generation that has passed away, and seen those who placed it there go
out of that doorway never to return; still it clings to that dingy old
warehouse, and still Russell, Rollins &amp; Co. is signed in that dingy old
counting-room at the head of the stairway. It is known the world over.
It is heard of on the cotton-fields of Texas, in the cane-brakes of
Cuba, and amid the rice-swamps of Carolina. The Chinaman speaks of it as
he sips his tea and handles his chop-sticks in the streets of Canton,
and the half-naked negro rattles its gold as he gathers palm-oil and the
copal-gum on the western coast of Africa. Its plain initials, painted in
black on a white ground, float from tall masts over many seas, and its
simple 'promise to pay,' scrawled in a bad hand on a narrow strip of
paper, unlocks the vaults of the best bankers in Europe. And yet, it is
a dingy old sign! Men look up to it as they pass by, and wonder that a
cracked, weather-beaten board that would not sell for a dollar, should
be counted 'good for a million.'</p>

<p>It is a dingy old warehouse, with narrow, dark, cobwebbed windows, and
wide, rusty iron shutters, which, as the bleak November wind sweeps up
old Long Wharf, swing slowly on their hinges with a sharp, grating
creak. I heard them in my boyhood. Perched on a tall stool at that old
desk, I used to listen, in the long winter-nights, to those strange,
wild cries, till I fancied they were voices of the uneasy dead, come
back to take the vacant seats beside me, and to pace again, with ghostly
tread, the floor of that dark old counting-room. They were ever a
mystery and a terror to me; but they never creaked so harshly, or cried
so wildly, as on a bleak November night, not many years ago, when I
turned my steps, for the last time, up the trembling old stairway.</p>

<p>It was just after nightfall. A single gas-burner threw a dim, uncertain
light over the old desk, and lit up the figure of a tall, gray-headed
man, who was bending over it. He had round, stooping shoulders, and
long, spindling limbs. One of his large feet, encased in a thick,
square-toed shoe, rested on the round of the desk, the other, which was
planted squarely on the floor, upheld his spare, gaunt frame. His face
was thin and long, and two deep, black lines under his eyes contrasted
strangely with the pallid whiteness of his features. His clothes were of
the fashion of some years ago, and had, no doubt, served long as his
'Sunday best,' before being degraded to daily duty. They were of plain
black, and though not shabby, were worn and threadbare, and of decidedly
economical appearance. Every thing about him, indeed, wore an economical
look. His scant coat-tails, narrow pants, and short waistcoat, showed
that the cost of each inch of material had been counted, while his thin
hair, brushed carefully over his bald head, had not a lock to spare; and
even his large, sharp bones were covered with only just enough flesh to
hold them comfortably together. He had stood there till his eye was dim
and his step feeble, and though he had, for twenty years&mdash;when handing
in his semi-annual trial-balances to the head of the house&mdash;declared
that each one was his last, every body said he would continue to stand
there till his own trial-balance was struck, and his earthly accounts
were closed forever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>As I entered, he turned his mild blue eye upon me, and taking my hand
warmly in his, exclaimed:</p>

<p>'My dear boy'&mdash;I was nearly forty&mdash;'I am glad to see you.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to see <i>you</i>, David.'</p>

<p>'Why, bless me, Mr. Kirke, is that you?' exclaimed a much younger man,
springing from his seat near the other, and grasping me by both hands.
'What has brought you to Boston?'</p>

<p>'Business, Frank. I've just arrived, and go back to-morrow. Come! my
wife is in the carriage at the door, and wants you to spend the evening
with us.'</p>

<p>'I can't&mdash;I'm very sorry,' and he added, in a lower tone, '<i>she</i> has
just heard of her father's death, and goes home to-morrow. I have
engaged to pass the evening with her.'</p>

<p>'Her father dead! how was it?'</p>

<p>'He was thrown from his horse, and died the same day. She knew nothing
of it till yesterday. I can not neglect her now. I will spend to-morrow
with mother.'</p>

<p>He always called her <i>mother</i>, though he was not her son. He had done it
when a child, and now that he was a man, hers was the dearest name he
knew. He loved her as his mother, and she loved him as her son. But any
woman might have loved him. His straight, closely-knit, sinewy frame,
dark, deep-set eyes, and broad, open forehead, overhung with thick,
brown hair, were only the outshadowing of a beautiful mind, of an open,
upright, manly nature, whose firm and steady integrity nothing could
shake.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry to hear it,' I replied; 'but go down and see her, while I
speak to Mr. Hallet.'</p>

<p>Rapping at the door of an inner office, separated from the outer one by
a ground-glass partition, I was admitted by a tall, dark man, who, with
a stiff and slightly embarrassed manner, said to me:</p>

<p>'I am glad to see you, Mr. Kirke. Pray, be seated.'</p>

<p>As he pointed to a chair, a shorter and younger gentleman, who was
writing at another desk, rose, and slapping me familiarly on the back,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'My dear fellow, how are you?'</p>

<p>'Very well, Cragin, how are you?'</p>

<p>'Good as new&mdash;never better in my life&mdash;how goes the world with you?'</p>

<p>The last speaker was not more than thirty-three, but a bald spot on the
top of his head, and a slight falling-in of his mouth, caused by
premature decay of the teeth, made him seem several years older. He had
marked but not regular features, and a restless, dark eye, which opened
and shut with a peculiar wink that kept time with the motion of his lips
in speaking. His clothes were cut in a loose, jaunty style, and his
manner, though brusque and abrupt, betokened, like his face, a free,
frank, manly character. He was ten or twelve years the junior of the
other, and as unlike him as one man can be unlike another.</p>

<p>The older gentleman, as I have said, was tall and dark. He had a high,
bold forehead, and wore heavy gray whiskers, trimmed with the utmost
nicety, and meeting under a sharp, narrow chin. His face was large and
full, and his nose pointed and prominent, but his mouth was small, and
gathered in at the corners like a rat's; and, as if to add to the
rat-resemblance, its small, white teeth seemed borrowed from the jaws of
that animal. There was a stately precision in his manner, and a stealthy
softness in his tread, that would have impressed a stranger unfavorably;
but <i>I</i> knew him. We had been boys together, and he loved me as he loved
his own son. How well he loved <i>him</i>, the reader will learn, if he
follows the course of my story.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen&mdash;Mr. Hallet and Mr. Cragin&mdash;were the senior partners
in the great house of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Replying satisfactorily to the inquiry of Mr. Cragin, I turned to the
older partner, and said:</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. Hallet, how does Frank get on?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! very well&mdash;knows a little too much, like most young men of his age,
but he does very well.'</p>

<p>''Very well,' Mr. Ballet! d&mdash;d if he don't&mdash;he's the smartest boy
living&mdash;made a clean forty thousand for us not two months ago&mdash;forced it
on Hallet against his better judgment!' And Mr. Cragin laughed till he
showed all that was left of two rows of tobacco-stained teeth.</p>

<p>'How was it Cragin?' I asked, greatly pleased.</p>

<p>A short rap came at the office-door, and Frank entered, his hat in his
hand.</p>

<p>'Mother insists on my taking supper with her&mdash;will you go now, sir?' he
said, addressing me.</p>

<p>Before I could reply, Mr. Hallet, rather sharply, asked:</p>

<p>'Have you finished your letters for the steamer?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'What have you said to Maclean, Maris &amp; Co., about the gum-copal?'</p>

<p>'I will show you, sir.'</p>

<p>And going into the other room, Frank returned in a moment with an open
letter, still wet from the copying-press. Mr. Hallet took it and read it
over slowly and carefully, then handing it back, he said, in the
slightly pompous tone which was natural to him:</p>

<p>'That will do&mdash;you can go.'</p>

<p>I was rising to bid them 'good-evening,' when the senior said to me:</p>

<p>'Mr. Kirke, I dislike to trespass on your time, but I would like to
confer with you for a moment, on a private matter.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir.' And I added: 'Frank, tell your mother I will meet you
at the hotel in half an hour.'</p>

<p>'But I must be in Cambridge by eight o'clock,' replied the young man,
looking a little chop-fallen.</p>

<p>'Well, don't wait for me&mdash;I will see you to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Bidding me 'good-night,' he left; and Mr. Cragin, seeing that his
partner would be alone with me, left shortly afterward. As soon as
Cragin was gone, Mr. Hallet, opening the door, called:</p>

<p>'David!'</p>

<p>The book-keeper entered, and took a seat beside me.</p>

<p>'Mr. Kirke,' said Mr. Hallet, when the other was seated, 'I want to talk
with you and David about Frank. He has entangled himself with that
Southern girl, and, I hear, means to marry her. I strongly object to it.
I've not a particle of influence with him, and <i>you</i> must prevent it.'</p>

<p>'Why should we prevent it?' I asked, rather sharply. 'What is there
against the young woman?'</p>

<p>'Nothing against her character, but she'd not be a fit wife for Frank.
These Southern women are educated with wrong ideas&mdash;they make poor wives
for poor men. He must marry a rich girl, or one brought up with
New-England habits. This one would bring him nothing, and spend all he
made.'</p>

<p>'But she is an only child, and her father is rich.'</p>

<p>'Pshaw! that is bosh! Preston always lived high, and I'll guarantee his
estate is bankrupt. I'm sorry for it, for he owes us.'</p>

<p>'Is that so! Largely?' 'No, not largely; how much is he overdrawn,
David?'</p>

<p>'Eighty-two hundred and odd.'</p>

<p>'I'm surprised at that,' I said. 'The old house did not allow such
things.'</p>

<p>'Neither do we; 'twas Cragin's work. He thought 'twould annoy Frank if
the drafts went back, and'&mdash;he hesitated a moment&mdash;'he insisted upon
it.'</p>

<p>'I am opposed to interfering in such matters. I always taught Frank to
think for himself,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'You taught him to think too much for himself. He is self-willed and
headstrong to a fault.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps his father might have trained him better, if&mdash;he had tried,' I
replied, with a slight sneer.</p>

<p>'Pardon me, Mr. Kirke, I meant no reflection on your management of him.
I only feel that this is a most important step, and he ought to be
advised. He should marry rich, for he has nothing, and can not rely upon
me.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>'He does not rely upon you; but he is a partner now, and his income
ought to enable him to support a wife.'</p>

<p>'His income is uncertain; he may not remain long in the concern,'
replied Mr. Hallet coolly.</p>

<p>David started; his face reddened to the roots of his hair, and he asked
in a sententious way, showing even in his expenditure of breath the
close economy that was the rule of his life: 'Who told you that, Mr.
Hallet?'</p>

<p>'No one,' replied that gentleman, seemingly surprised at the abrupt
question; 'I am deliberating on it myself. He is sowing dissension
between Cragin and me. The lowest boy in the office; even you, David,
pay more heed to him than to <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>'That may be your own fault,' I said, a little sarcastically; 'if you
should treat him as Cragin and David do, you might have nothing to
complain of.'</p>

<p>'I treat him well, sir; but I make him <i>know his place</i>.' The last words
were emphasized in a hard, wicked tone.</p>

<p>Certain old recollections had been rushing across my memory during the
latter part of this conversation, and this last remark brought me to my
feet, as I said: 'You treat him like a dog, sir! I have seen it. If he
were not your son, he should not stay with you another day! But I warn
you, John Hallet&mdash;do not go too far. Cast that boy off&mdash;harm him to the
extent of a hair&mdash;and, so help me God, I will strip you of the lying
cloak in which you hide your false, hypocritical soul, and show men
<i>what you are!</i>'</p>

<p>In my excitement, I had crossed the room, and stood then directly before
him. His face flushed and his eye quailed before my steady gaze, but he
said nothing.</p>

<p>David remarked, in a mild tone: 'Edmund, that an't the right spirit; it
an't.'</p>

<p>'You don't know the whole, David; if you did, even <i>you</i> would say he is
the basest man living.'</p>

<p>Hallet pressed his teeth together; his eyes flashed fire, and he seemed
about to spring upon me; but mastering his passion, he rose after a
moment and extended his hand, saying: 'Come, Mr. Kirke, this is not the
talk of old friends! Let us shake hands and forget it.'</p>

<p>'Never, sir! I took your hand for the last time when I left this
counting-room, twenty years ago. I never touch it again! I shall tell
that boy <i>to-night</i> that you are his father.'</p>

<p>'You will not do so imprudent a thing. I will do any thing for him&mdash;any
thing you require. I promise you&mdash;on my honor,' and the stately head of
the great house of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co., sank into a chair and bent
down his face like a criminal in the dock.</p>

<p>'I can not trust you,' I said, as I paced the room,</p>

<p>'You can, Edmund; he means it. He is sorry for the wrong he's done,'
said the old book-keeper, in that mild, winning tone which had made me
so love him in my boyhood.</p>

<p>'Well, let him <i>prove</i> that he means it; let him tell you all; let him
tell you how much he has had to repent of!'</p>

<p>'I <i>have</i> told him all. I told him years ago.'</p>

<p>'Did you tell him how you cast off that poor girl? how for years on her
knees she vainly plead for a paltry pittance to keep her child from
starving and herself from sin? Did you tell him how you forced her on
the street? how you drove her from you with curses, when she prayed you
to save her from the pit of infamy into which you had plunged her? Did
you tell him,' and I hissed the words in his ear, while he writhed on
his seat in such agony as only the guilty can feel; 'how, at last, after
all those wretched years, she died of starvation and disease, with all
that mountain of sin on her soul, and all of it heaped on her by YOU!'</p>

<p>'Oh! no! I did not&mdash;could not tell him that! I did not know I had done
<i>that!</i>' groaned the stately gentleman.</p>

<p>'You lie, John Hallet! You know you lie! and may God deal with you as
you dealt with her,' and I took up my hat and laid my hand on the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>'Stop, stop, Edmund; don't go with those words. You would not have God
do to <i>you</i> as you have done to others!' said David, in the same mild
tone as before.</p>

<p>'True, David. I ought not to wish him harm; but I loathe and detest the
hypocritical villain. Frank shall leave him to-night, and forever!' and
again I laid my hand on the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Hallet looked up; his face was pale as marble, and his hands
clenched tightly the arms of his chair, 'Don't go, Mr. Kirke,' he cried;
'stay one moment. Can't this be arranged?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. Sign a dissolution article at once&mdash;<i>here</i>&mdash;NOW, and give
Frank your check for twenty thousand dollars.'</p>

<p>'No, no! You don't mean that! It is too much&mdash;you can not ask <i>that</i>!'
gasped the great merchant.</p>

<p>'Too much for the son of a man worth a million? Too much to pay for
starving his mother, and turning him adrift at six years old? It is not
enough! He must have <i>thirty</i> thousand!'</p>

<p>'You are mad, Mr. Kirke!' And he rose, and looked at me with a pleading
face. 'I can not pay that amount down. It is impossible.'</p>

<p>'David, how much has he in bank on private account?'</p>

<p>Mr. Hallet cast a beseeching glance at his book-keeper; but without
moving a muscle, the old man quietly replied: 'Fifty-three thousand.'</p>

<p>'I knew you lied, Hallet. It is natural to you.'</p>

<p>'But I can't let Frank go without Mr. Cragin's consent.'</p>

<p>'I will arrange with Cragin. Sign the check and draw the paper at once,
or I go.'</p>

<p>'But give me time to think&mdash;see me to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'I shall never exchange a word with you after to-night. You can have ten
minutes&mdash;not a second more,' and I took out my watch to count the time.</p>

<p>He seated himself at his desk, and rested his head on his hand for a
moment; then turning to me, he said: 'You promise that this interview,
and all that has passed, shall never be mentioned by you?'</p>

<p>'I do&mdash;never to your injury.'</p>

<p>'David, please write the check,' said the senior partner, as he
proceeded himself to draw up the agreement. In a few minutes he handed
it to me. It was short, and merely recited that the co-partnership which
had theretofore existed between John Hallet, Augustus Cragin, and Henry
F. Mandell, under the name and style of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co., was on
that day dissolved by mutual consent; said Mandell withdrawing, and
assigning the control of all the assets of said firm to said Hallet and
Cragin, and releasing to said Hallet any portion of its capital and
profits to which he might be entitled.</p>

<p>I read the document, and quietly handed it back. 'That will not do, Mr.
Hallet. Thirty thousand dollars settles with <i>you</i>, his father. I have
not, and <i>shall</i> not make any settlement with the firm. David must pay
Frank what is his due&mdash;no more, no less.'</p>

<p>'But,' began Mr. Hallet.</p>

<p>'I have nothing more to say on the subject, sir.'</p>

<p>He drew a deep sigh. The parting with an only son, and with thirty
thousand dollars, at one and the same time, affected him deeply. He
might have borne the loss of the son; but the loss of so much money rent
his small, black soul into fragments. However, he rewrote the paper, and
passed it to me. It was all right; and when he had signed and David had
witnessed it, I placed it in my pocket-book. Then, with a trembling
hand, he handed me the check. It was drawn to my order; and I remarked,
as I took it: 'This is not what I require, sir. I want your check,
indorsed by David.'</p>

<p>'This is most unaccountable, Mr. Kirke. Do you question my check for
thirty thousand dollars?' he asked, his face flushing with anger.</p>

<p>'Oh! no, sir, not at all; but you might stop its payment. With David's
indorsement, you would not <i>dare</i> to do it.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>'I will indorse it,' said David; and he quietly proceeded to write
another.</p>

<p>That cold, hard, soulless man had a wife and children; but that old
book-keeper was the only being in all this wide world that he loved!</p>

<p>Placing the check with the other paper, I shook David by the hand, and
bidding him 'good-night', passed down the old stairway.</p>

<p>As Frank is the hero of my history, I will, in another chapter, go back
some seventeen years, and tell the reader how he came to be under my
control, and how he rose to be a partner in the great house of Russell,
Rollins &amp; Co.</p>

<h2><a name="LITERARY_NOTICES" id="LITERARY_NOTICES"></a>LITERARY NOTICES.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Among the Pines. By Edmund Kirke</span>. New-York: J. R. Gilmore,
532 Broadway. 1862.</p></div>

<p>Perhaps it is not altogether in rule to say much of a work which has
appeared in our pages. But we may at least call attention to what others
have said. And good authority&mdash;plenty of it, such authority as should
make a reputation for any book&mdash;has declared <i>The Pines</i> to be in truth
a work of the highest merit and of a new order. It is a perfectly
truthful record of scenes and characters drawn from personal experience
in the South; combining the accuracy of Olmstead's works with the
thrilling interest of <i>Uncle Tom</i>. It should be fairly stated&mdash;as the
author desires it should be&mdash;that every thing did not occur precisely in
the order in which it is here narrated. But all is <i>true</i>&mdash;every page
speaks for itself in this particular. No stronger piece of local
coloring ever issued from the American press. We seem, in reading it, to
live in the South&mdash;to know the people who come before us. All of them
are, indeed, life-portraits. In one or two instances, the very names of
the originals remain unchanged.</p>

<p>In it the author deals fairly and honorably with the South. The renegade
Yankee, and not the native planter, is made to bear the heaviest blow.
The principal character, Colonel J&mdash;&mdash;, is one of nature's noblemen,
struggling through aristocratic education and circumstance with an evil
whose evil he cannot comprehend. Very valuable indeed are the sketches
of life among the 'mean whites.' No descriptions of them to be compared
with these in <i>The Pines</i> have ever yet appeared. They rise clear as
cameo-reliefs on a dark ground, and we feel that they too are like the
slave-holder, victims like the slave, of a system, and not with him,
deliberate wretches. Their squalor, ignorance, pride, and
dependence&mdash;their whole social <i>status</i>, inferior to that of the blacks
whom they despise, appear as set forth, we do not say by a master-hand,
but <i>by themselves</i>.</p>

<p>This work, tolerant and just, yet striking, has appeared at the right
time. While interesting as a novel, it is full of solid, simple
facts&mdash;it is based on them and built up with them. Without attempting to
set forth a principle, it shows beyond dispute that slavery does not pay
in the South as well as free labor would, and that the blacks would
produce more as free laborers than as slaves. It shows that Emancipation
for the sake of the White Man is a great truth, and that the white man
would be benefited by raising the sense of independence in the black,
and by elevating him in every way in which he is capable of improvement.</p>

<p>It may be said with great truth of <i>The Pines</i>, that it would be
difficult to find a book in which such striking facts and vivid pictures
are set forth with such perfect simplicity of language. There is no
effort at fine writing in it, and no consciousness of its absence. The
author never seems to have realized that a story could be told for
effect, and the natural result has been the most unintentional yet the
strongest effect. The practical eye of one familiar with planks and
turpentine, building and farming, business and furniture, economy and
comfort, betrays itself continually. He sees how things could be
bettered not as a mere philanthropist would try to see them, but as one
who knows how capital ought to be em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>ployed, and he appreciates the fact
that the sufferings of the people of every class in the South are really
based on the <i>wastefulness</i> of the present system. That this spirit
should be combined with a keen observation of local humor, and in
several instances with narratives imbued with deep pathos, is not,
however, remarkable. The man who can most vividly set forth facts and
transfer nature to paper, seldom misses variety.</p>

<p>We rejoice that this work has met with such favorable reception from the
public, and are happy to state that the author will continue his
contributions to these columns. He has already, by a single effort,
established a wide-spread reputation, and we know that he has that in
him which will induce efforts of equal merit and a future which will be
honorably recorded in histories of the literature of the present day.</p>

<span class="smcap">Epes Sargent</span>. New-York: G. P. Putnam. Boston: A. K.
Loring. 1862.</p></div>

<p>No better paper, no better type, can be desired than what is lavished
upon these beautiful editions of Putnam's works. It is a pleasure to
touch their silky, Baskerville-feeling leaves, and think that one
possesses in the series one more work <i>de luxe</i>, which 'any one' might
be glad to own. The present consists of The Whims and Oddities, with
the&mdash;originally&mdash;two volumes of National Tales: the former piquant and
variously eccentric; the latter written in a quaint, old-fashioned
style, which the editor compares justly to that of <span class="smcap">Boccaccio</span>,
yet which was really, till within some fifty years, so very common a
form of narration, having so much in common with Spanish and French
<i>nouvelettes</i>, that it is hardly worth while to suppose that
<span class="smcap">Hood</span> followed the great. Italian at all. The whole work is one
mass of entertainment, none the worse for having acquired somewhat of a
game-y flavor of age, and for gradually falling a little behind the
latest styles of humor. 'Mass! 'tis a merry book, and will make them
merry who read it!'</p>

Vol. V. New-York: G. P. Putnam. 1862.</p></div>

<p>The present volume of Hood's writings is composed of dramatic sketches,
odes, political satires, and miscellaneous pieces not generally
contained in former collections of his works. Among these is the long
and beautiful 'Lamia' in dramatic form; the 'Epping Hunt;' the poems of
sentiment; the inimitable Odes and Addresses to Great People, and some
scores of minor poems, mostly humorous, including, however, all of those
on which his reputation as a true poet of the highest rank is based.
Among these is the 'Lay of the Laborer,' a standing and bitter reproach
to England&mdash;the England of millions of pounds of capital&mdash;the England of
piety&mdash;the England of morality&mdash;the England of 'all the rights of man,'
where there are more paupers and more miseries than in any other land on
earth, and where there is accordingly the most social tyranny of any
country.</p>

Boston: Ticknor and Fields. 1862.</p></div>

<p>If there be, at the present day, an ungrateful task for an intelligent
reader or a conscientious reviewer, it is to be obliged to deal with a
work whose whole compass is merely that of a second-rate romance
inspired by rococo sentimentalism. We regret to speak thus of a book by
so eminent a writer as Mrs. Stowe; but when any one at this time
undertakes to build up a novel out of such material as cloisters, monks,
and nuns,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> Beato Angelico and frankincense, cavaliers and Savonarola,
with the occasional 'purple patch' of a rhyming Latin hymn&mdash;in short,
when we see the long-exhausted melo-dramatic style, which was years ago
thoroughly quizzed in 'Firmilian,' revived in the year 1862 in a work of
fiction, we can not refrain from expressing sorrow that a public can
still be found to welcome such a bouquet of faded and tattered
artificial flowers. There is something, indeed, almost painfully amusing
in the liberal use of perfectly exhausted and thoroughly hackneyed
elements of popular romance which appear in every page of <i>Agnes of
Sorrento</i>. A writer has said of the heroine, that 'she is one of those
ethereal females, only encountered in romance, who dwell on the brink of
exaltation, and never eat bread and butter without seeming to fly in the
face of Divine Providence.' But this feebly expresses the worn-out
ornamental piety of the work. It would require but very little
alteration to become one of the most intensely amusing books of the age.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Seventh Annual Report of the Insurance Commissioners of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts</span>.</p></div>

<p>An interesting collection of documents, which will be read or examined
with great pleasure by all who devote their attention to the rapidly
maturing science of insurance, a science which perhaps combines in its
range of material as much of the curious and useful as any other known;
the whole tending to one great lesson: that every thing should be
insured and that <i>no insurance should be taxed by Government</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Twenty-Fourth Annual Report of The Board of Education</span>.

<p>Apart from the vastly important testimony which these works bear to the
efforts annually made in our good State in the cause of education&mdash;the
great source, let us trust, of the politics to be&mdash;we seldom fail to
find in them many useful hints as to the practical business of teaching,
of which any writer on the subject would be glad to avail himself. Many
such, at least, we detect in the volume before us, and sincerely trust
that all will in due time bear their good fruit.</p>

<p>A poem of thirty-two pages, devoted to setting forth the incidents of
Concord and Lexington fights, in the Revolutionary days, and therefore
very appropriate to our own time. The 'plan' is excellent; the incidents
well devised, while many little lyrical touches here and there are truly
admirable. For instance, 'The White Cockade.'</p>

<h2><a name="EDITORS_TABLE" id="EDITORS_TABLE"></a>EDITOR'S TABLE</h2>


<p>The English journals and statesmen, in their excessive anxiety to
regulate every thing for the world in general and for America in
particular, quite lose sight of the fact, that before interfering in a
neighbor's affairs, it is best to know what the state of affairs may
really be. Of late, we have seen these makers of public opinion making
mischief through gross ignorance, to a degree well-nigh unparalleled in
history. On the strength of flying rumors, unfinished events imperfectly
reported, and through Secession slanders, their great leaders, both
representative and editorial, have ventured to spread before the masses
statements which must unavoidably tend to greatly exasperate and
alienate the people of our respective nations. They are blindly running
up scores of hatred, which at some day may call for fearful settlement.
Their influence is very great on the rank-loving multitude in their own
country&mdash;a multitude which, after all, is, in the majority, more
miserable and nearly as ignorant as that of any realm in Europe, or even
the East, for there are fewer paupers in Turkey or Syria than in wealthy
England. Yet, quite unheeding this, they continue to express sympathy
for the South, declare with Brougham that the bubble of Democracy has at
length burst, and chuckle over every Northern defeat. All of which shall
be duly remembered.</p>

<p>The grossest error into which these men have fallen, is that of
continually regarding our war not as a struggle between two great
principles, or as an unavoidable necessity, but simply as a strife
between two factions. Nearly every London editorial which we have seen
for weeks proves this. 'What will the North gain if it conquers the
South? What will the South make? What are <span class="smcap">WE</span> to benefit by a
victory of either?' It is perfectly natural, however, for a monarchy,
virtually without 'politics,' devoid of great progressive ideas, and
smothered by 'loyalty' and faith in an aristocracy, to see, as men did
in the middle ages, nothing but a dispute of rival forces in every
battle. It is 'Brown <i>vs</i>. Brown' to them, and nothing more. With the
exception of Bright and his friends, no one in England seems to
comprehend that our North has in itself the vital, progressive energy
which <i>must</i> give it victory&mdash;the same spirit which enables English
civilization to gain on the Hindoo or the New-Zealander&mdash;the spirit of
science and intelligence, which conquers ignorance.</p>

<p>The fact that English statesmen can talk so calmly of the possibilities
of Southern victory, and weigh with such equanimity the claims of the
combatants, simply proves their ignorance of the real condition of the
United States. And they <i>are</i> indeed very ignorant of us. Perhaps
ignorance and thoughtlessness were never more decidedly manifested than
in Brougham's late rhodomontade on the failure of Democracy in this
country. For, in fact, there is not difference enough between the
representative <i>power</i> of England and that of America to make a
question. Between Commons and our House of Representatives&mdash;the most
influential legislative bodies&mdash;there is no such great difference.
English writers have asserted that our government is actually the
strongest monarchy of the two, because our President possesses far
greater power of patronage and personal influence than the Queen. The
real difference is not between the forms of government, but between the
innate flunkeyism of the Briton and the independence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> American.
If we had the British government in every detail, and if John Bull were
to adopt our system, the countries would stand where they were, and each
gradually 'reform' itself, according to its ideas of reform, back into
the old routine. The Englishman, needing 'my Lord' and 'Her Gracious
Majesty,' and as unable to live without his golden calves of 'superiors'
as bees are to exist without a queen, would soon create them; while the
American blood, sprung from the republican Puritan, and developed into
strength on a continent, would very soon, after a nine days' f&eacute;te to his
new f&eacute;tish, kick it over, and instituting caucuses and primary
ward-meetings, or 'town-meetings,' (a ceremony which no European in
existence, save the Russian, is capable of properly managing,) would
soon have all back again in the old road.</p>

<p>Democracy among the 'Yankees' as well as all North-Americans who are
free from a servile respect for simple rank and money, is something very
different from that mere form which Brougham, and with him nearly all
Europe, believe it to be. We are not Frenchmen, or Englishmen, or
Orientals, to quietly sit down under any kind of government which chance
may impose, and exclaim: 'It is fate.' Democracy with us is not the mere
form which they imagine. It is, like the English government, like the
German, like the Pachalik of the Oriental, something as much a part of
us as our national physiognomy. A very great proportion of the
Englishmen who come here, remain flunkeys to the end&mdash;an American, other
than a soul-diseased disciple of Richmond sociology, or some weak
brother or sister dazed by court ball-tickets&mdash;quite as generally remain
a despiser of men who acknowledge other men as their betters by mere
birth. A love of freedom is in our blood, in our life, in our habits. We
are fond, it is true, of temporarily lionizing great people, but we soon
reduce them to our own level. America has shaken down more eminencies
into notorieties than any other country in the world&mdash;it is a severe and
terrible ordeal for great foreigners. Our eagerness to behold them is
simply a keen curiosity and a natural love of amusement which is soon
appeased. An American would crowd foremost to see Queen Victoria for the
first time in his life&mdash;the second opportunity would be neglected. But
the London shop-keeper who has seen that lady perhaps hundreds of times,
still rushes out in wild haste, with eyes wide open, to behold her when
she drives past. 'They can never get enough of it.' As one of their own
writers has observed, a London tradesman may have been swindled a
hundred times by real or sham noblemen, and yet no sooner does some
flaunting cheat with the <i>air noble</i> enter his shop, than the cockney
bows low and implores patronage with a cringing zeal only equaled by his
'uppishness' to humbler customers.</p>

<p>The truth simply is, that English thinkers wrongly judge our people to
be like their own, and as capable of promptly submitting to acknowledged
superiors. In the same blindness and ignorance, they see only two
parties, equal in all respects in this war, and realize nothing of the
innate vitality and irresistibly accretive power of free-labor, science,
and progress, when brought into opposition with a conservatism which
scorns every thing pertaining to the rights of the majority. Misled by
their associations, they believe that the 'Aristocratic' party must
triumph in the end, forgetting that even in their own country capital is
gradually destroying the old land-marks which divided the privileged
classes from the masses. We who virtually occupy a higher stand-point in
history, though, perhaps, we are newer dwellers in our domain and not as
yet as comfortable in it as they in theirs, can, however, afford to
laugh at their opinions and threats. A nation, whose utmost effort could
not raise above thirty thousand men for a war in which the point of
honor between themselves and the French was at stake, is not the one to
lay down laws to the American North,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> which could&mdash;probably without
drafting&mdash;bring its million into the field. It is worth remembering
that, had they sent us their Warrior, as they threatened after the Mason
and Slidell difficulty, she would have met with the Monitor!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Three hundred thousand men are wanted&mdash;and that right early!</p>

<p>Let there be meetings, speeches, subscriptions&mdash;let every thing that is
vigorous and impulsive and patriotic thrill the people forthwith: Let
there be no lagging in the good cause. Never since the war begun was
there a time when a fierce rally was more needed. We have it in our
power to crush this rebellion to atoms, if the people will but once
arouse in their might. Even this draft for three hundred thousand, when
we come to portion it off among those remaining in our counties, becomes
quite trifling.</p>

<p>'More than shooting goes to making war.' All who are in the North can
fight to good purpose, if they will, every man and woman of them, <i>do
their best</i> to raise soldiers, equip them and take care of their
families.</p>

<p>Men! rise up and go forth. You will acquire a patent of nobility by
serving in this war, which will be worth more to you and yours in coming
days than any title on earth. You go to great risks&mdash;but not to any
thing which can outweigh the good you can do for this truly holy cause.
Have you lived lives 'of no great account'&mdash;<i>now</i> is the time to rise to
a position&mdash;to be some body, and make your mark. Have you been a mere
cipher in the great sum of life&mdash;a neglected trifle&mdash;now is the time to
raise yourself to a real value. It can never be said of a man who served
in this war that he was of no great account.</p>

<p>Has your life been stained&mdash;by misfortune or your own faults? Now is the
time to wipe out the old score and begin afresh. What cautious, timid
Peace rejects as bad, bold, hearty War grasps at with eagerness and
makes good and great.</p>

<p>Are you poor, and dragging out a dull, base life, more sluggishly than
your abilities deserve? Go to the war&mdash;in God's name, go to the war! Who
knows what changes in life you may live through&mdash;what new opportunities
may open before you! In that wide Southland lie a million homes, and
there will be those left behind who&mdash;if you fight bravely&mdash;will give the
matter no rest till you are richly rewarded. There is not a soldier in
this war at this instant who is not acquiring what may be a fortune.
<i>Somebody</i> must occupy the lands left vacant in the South!</p>

<p>Are you a lover? Make her proud of you.</p>

<p>Do not fear the risks. That is a poor, wretched life which has never run
the chances of death.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Fast in battle the bullets fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But many a soldier the bullets pass by.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Arise all! Up, Guards, and at 'em! Let there be a general up-stirring
and a hearty good-will in this matter. The enemy have brought every
white man among them into the field&mdash;they are kept alive solely by the
blacks. One tremendous effort, such as we are capable of making, would
sweep them from the face of the earth. Another struggle and we reach the
shore.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Many years ago, the South began to alienate itself from the Union, by
blindly abusing every thing pertaining to the North as 'Abolition.' They
wanted a grievance; they would have one, and so yelled 'Wolf! wolf!'
till the wolf came in roaring earnest. In like manner, the Democratic
dabblers in mischief are now yelling 'Radical,' abusing emancipation,
and doing all in their power to hoist themselves into notoriety. They
are determined to force separate parties into existence, and they will
end by accomplishing their purpose, by being in a losing reactionary
minority, which will bear the brand in later days of having been the
most unprincipled, narrow-minded, and desperately selfish faction which
this country has ever known.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Gentle reader, accept the following from a friend in the quaint spirit
in which it is written, and understand not by bad company aught that is
evil&mdash;for if we read the word of the enigma, the 'bad' among her
'friends of the future' is indeed goodness-that saving salt which is
often found among many who are too hastily banned as lost in the world.
So, we pray you, judge it kindly:</p>


<h4>FRIENDS OF THE FUTURE.</h4>

<p class='center'>'There is no real amusement except in bad company.'&mdash;<i>Italian Proverb</i>.</p>


<p>Reprehensible but real sentiment of your humble servant, O dearly
beloved reader! Your lips reprove me, but your heart forgives and
sympathizes! And that heart rebels with mine against that adverse Past
which has given to us so little of 'real amusement' from 'bad company,'
and demands, like mine, reparation from the Future for the sufferings we
have endured from unexceptionable and perfectly good company!</p>

<p>The representative men and women of that small and select bad company,
(who have made the desert of our lives to blossom with roses, violets,
strawberries and cream,) how distinctly they stand out on the horizon of
memory! I see them&mdash;I count them, as easily as those few stately pines
on yonder hill-top&mdash;one, two, three, four, five, six, <i>seven</i>. No more?
What! not a delightful eight? Who has translated the murmur of the
summer wind among the pines as 'No more?' '<i>No more?</i>' Alas! to-day they
give that answer to me, as I seek for one other in that bad and beloved
company! 'But he cometh'&mdash;<i>adveniat</i>&mdash;he cometh in the future. O eighth!
your morning will yet dawn.</p>

<p>Welcome, O Friend of the Future I whatever thy sex. Welcome! whether in
cashmere and graceful crinolineaments, or in gray-suit and
<i>grecio</i>!&mdash;only be 'more of the same sort.' Heaven is <i>not</i> so cruel! to
give us five hundred dear twin-friends, on whom one has to tie five
hundred different colored bows (I assure you, Monsieur, the
ribbon-florists have this season produced <i>five hundred colors</i>) in
order to distinguish one from another! Heaven would not do this cruel
wrong without offering some apology&mdash;some mitigation.</p>

<p>Ah! you sigh. Your heart, then, <i>does</i> forgive me&mdash;I knew it would. Give
me your hand, (such a soft, white hand!) I confess the proverb did
<i>sound</i> a little naughty, but it's not <i>really</i> so. At all events, it is
the <i>truth</i>&mdash;and, you know, we</p>

<p class='center'>
'Can not tell a lie!' G. W.
</p>

<p>Ah! this hand, though soft and white, is no longer plump and
unconscious; it has <i>suffered</i>! You, too, have been bored&mdash;ah! I <i>must</i>
kiss it.</p>

<p class='center'>
'I, too, am human.'
</p>

<p>I also have been bored! Come, now, you mistrust me no longer-and I&mdash;I
love you! I <i>love</i> you, and, therefore, I want to amuse you; perhaps, by
Heaven's blessing, I may prove 'bad company' myself!</p>

<p>For I can not but believe that somewhere in the purple Future, or latent
amid the green leaves of the possible Fairy-dom, (in which some rich
enchanter of an uncle is to lea-re us all an heritage,) there bide,
waitingly, certain dear friends&mdash;delightful, daring, witty, and wicked
creatures&mdash;like yourself, O reader I&mdash;with whom I am destined to be,
spiritually, 'very much married indeed;' or if the expression sound too
polygamatical, let me simply say <i>li&eacute;.</i> [For Heaven's sake, accept that
as French, warm with an accent, and not as English, cold without one.]
<i>Li&eacute;</i> means 'bound'&mdash;anchored, so to speak, to an intimate in an
amicable manner. And it is in their friendship&mdash;in their kind and tender
words and courteous deeds, and winsome ways, that I most truly <i>live</i>.</p>

<p>Where these dearmost ones may bide, I know not. Seven&mdash;yes&mdash;seven I have
met, whom I cherish like diamonds of delight in the cotton of memory. It
is worth noting, my dear, in this connection, that <i>sev-en</i> is one of
the conjugations in Turkish of the root <i>sev</i>, or 'loving,' and 'them
old Turks,' you know&mdash;but I am digressing. Are there not still to come
seven&mdash;yea, seventy times seven, (I have mislaid my Koran, in which the
number is more accurately stated,) of my Friends of the Future!</p>

<p>But I know what they are like. Oh! the charming, delightful wretches,
how I enjoy looking at them&mdash;in fact, 'I admire to see' them&mdash;as they
sweep along through the golden halls of my Schloss Dream-berg. Such nice
clothes as they wear&mdash;the ducks! Such good things as they
say&mdash;such&mdash;such&mdash;</p>

<p>It is too warm to-day to attempt superla<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>tives. It were better to
drink&mdash;say, iced lemonade, in which&mdash;for you, dear reader&mdash;by some
mistake a <i>little</i> sherry has been cobblered. <i>Sherrare est humanum</i>.
The Rabbis, we are told, forbade the children of Israel to puff the fire
on the Sabbath with bellows, though they might keep it going by blowing
through a straw. Wherefore, to this day, certain of the devout 'keep it
a-going' by means of a straw&mdash;only by some strange mistake in
interpretation, or by some vowel-points getting mislaid, they, instead
of blowing <i>from</i> them in the straw, suck <i>toward</i> them. And their
'society' is a large one.</p>

<p>But we were talking of 'good company,' as they say in 'good
society'&mdash;not of 'good society,' as they say in 'good company.' And,
therefore, although <i>not</i> 'a retired clergyman,' and devoutly hoping
that my 'sands of life' are not by a very long while 'run out,' (for I
want to see my future friends,) I would yet (without these advantages)
offer you 'some slight relief,' and would seek to assuage your
sufferings resulting from too much good company; and since we have so
few friends in the past who have amused us, turn we our 'regards' to the
possible</p>

<p>Reader, have you in your house a <i>vivarium</i> or <i>aquarium</i>, or any other
variety of animal curiosity-shop, under care of the younger members? If
so, the subjoined sketch may awaken in your mind more than one vivid
souvenir, We know, at all events, that some of its 'features' were
founded on facts; that is, if a 'feature' can be 'founded.' However, we
take the phrase from&mdash;but no, we are sufficiently abused by the
Democratic editors, as it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Editor of the Continental</span>: Among the lesser joys of maternity,
that of having your children interested in a vivarium is one of the
least&mdash;in fact, it is an elephantine sorrow.</p>

<p>James, my eldest son, is a genius; before he was twelve years old, he
invented a rat-trap, which not only caught rats, but cut off their tails
and&mdash;let them go. At thirteen, he spoke Italian so fluently that he
caused a hand-organ grinder to throw a brick at him. At fourteen, he
came home one day with six large panes of glass, some tin and putty, and
made a vivarium, a thing full of mud, water, leeches, dirty weeds, and
other improvements.</p>

<p>When James had finished his glass case, he placed it in the front
drawing-room window, so that the public might behold that exquisite
process of nature, tadpoles turning into spring water-chickens, as they
call frogs on hotel bill of fares. Unfortunately, the gold fish he put
in with them killed the tadpoles while they still wiggled, and a
pickerel that he had bought of a fellow-school-boy for half-price, its
tail being ragged, ate up the gold-fish.</p>

<p>If at any time vegetables bought for the table were missing, we all knew
where they went to; in fact, that vivarium, from the time green peas
came until cabbages were ripe, resembled a <i>soupe &agrave; la Jardini&egrave;re</i>, and
in summer-time a second course of boiled fish might easily have been
found there.</p>

<p>One evening, when I had a little company, and while Fanny Schell was
singing an aria, he caused her to conclude with an unusually high
scream, by announcing at the top of his voice, while he pointed to the
vivarium:</p>

<p class='center'>
'Ma, the leeches have all crawled out!'
</p>

<p>Imagine the feelings my little company had the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the fright James gave me one hot night in July; it
was Saturday, I remember well, for that was one of my son's holidays,
and he returned home toward night unusually covered with mud, from a
long walk in the country, evidently having been taking practical lessons
in ditching. He was so very quiet after he returned, that I might have
known he was in mischief. However, when his bed-time came, he kissed me
good-night, and said:</p>

<p>'O ma! I have such a surprise for you in the morning.'</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had the surprise that night. Business called my husband
away from the city that morning, and I was alone. Waking up from a sound
sleep about midnight, I distinctly heard somebody working on an anvil,
like a blacksmith, 'ching-a-ling! ching-a-ling!' It evidently came from
the drawing-room, and my fears at once told me it was a thief trying to
break into the house. Next I heard some one whistle, like a man calling
a dog, 'wheh! wheh! wheh!' Finally a dog barking, 'woo, woo, wooh!'
Thoroughly alarmed, I sprang to the front-window, and called: 'Police!
thieves!' until I managed to arouse the neighbors. I had the key of the
front-door in my chamber; this I threw down to a police-officer, and in
company with two others he boldly entered the house, lit the gas, and
found&mdash;that vivarium full of bull-frogs!</p>

<p>My son banished the frogs and introduced cat-fish, (or, as they call
them in Boston, 'horn-pouts.') One night, my great Angora cat, a cat
born in the Rue de Seine, educated in the best French <i>&Eacute;cole des
chattes</i>, and brought to this country by my husband, fell a victim to
<i>la gourmandise</i>, by falling into the vivarium while fishing for
cat&mdash;horn-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>pout&mdash;fish. James found her there in the morning, drowned,
and partially eaten up by those she had hoped to eat. She went into the
<i>boudoir</i> to Pout, and 'had done it.'</p>

<p>That finished the vivarium. I sincerely hope these trials to mothers
will never again become the rage, and that something dry will next tempt
our children's mania for home amusements. <span class="smcap">Cornelia</span>.</p>

<p>'The Kansas John Brown Song,' which lately appeared in these columns,
and which we credited to the Kansas <i>Herald</i>&mdash;following the lead of the
newspaper where we found it&mdash;was written by the Rev. William W. Patton,
of Chicago, for the <i>Tribune</i> of that city.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Though so often trampled down by the heel of patriotism, the old serpent
of treason and disunion still keeps lifting his head and hissing
venomously. In New-York, Fernando Wood&mdash;that incarnation of Northern
secession&mdash;the man who dared to issue a proclamation recommending the
inhabitants of the city of which he was mayor to go off with the South,
is plotting and planning (unpunished, of course) with spirits of kindred
baseness, to build up the old order and reestablish the rule of
corruption. At Washington, all the timid, time-serving, and place-hoping
members of Congress have been holding 'Conservative' meetings, at which
the most insolent or timid propositions have been put forth; some of the
traitors manifesting clear as day their undisguised sympathy for the
rebels, others speaking only to preserve their tattered characters as
Unionists. The upshot of all was given in a resolution that Congress has
no power to deprive a person of his property, unless that person has
been duly convicted by a trial by jury.</p>

<p>We are not through the war as yet. Possibly, ere the end come, the
country may have something to say as to the propriety of our
representatives holding meetings to protect and favor rebels in their
'rights.'</p>

me to call your attention to this fine lot of leather. Did I hear

<p>There is often some fun at auctions. One of the queerest ever reported
to us was held in a French-Spanish be-Germanized village on the
frontier, where business was transacted in something of a polyglott
manner, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Gentlemen-Messieurs-Senores y meine Herrne, I've got here for

such a quadruple thread.</p>

<p>Two 'after-Norse' poems are ours this month-the first from an esteemed
Philadelphia correspondent&mdash;the second from another of the same State,
but more inland. The following, we may observe, is written in the
measure which most prevails in Icelandic poems:</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><b>THE VIKINGS.</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the brown waters</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dash the swift prows;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the helm Valor stands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Death at the bows:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vainly the foeman shrinks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Palsied in fright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vain are his struggles, yet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Vainer his flight.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Triple defenses&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fire, water, and steel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guard the gate of the West</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From the Northerner's keel.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though defiant at midnight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ere morning the wrath</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the terrible sea-kings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has leveled a path.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rampart and heavy gun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From o'er the bay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose broad waters stretch</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Twixt the ships and their prey:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But shattered the rampart lies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Silent the gun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the circle of living fire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Madly rolls on.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wide yawn the timbers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wild waters rush in,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the ship settles fast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mid the fierce battle-din:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet her guns hurl defiance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As, stern to the last,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sea sucks her in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With her flag on the mast.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sons of the Northman,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose banner of old</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spread the shadow of terror</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From each grisly fold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his broad heritage</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Worthy are ye:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Win it and wear it well,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Kings of the sea.</span><br />
</p>


<p>The next 'Norse' is longer. We find in it a brave ring of true poetry:</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><b>1861.</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Oh! dark and true and tender is the North.'</span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loud leaps the strong wind forth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fierce from the caves of the mighty North,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Ages untold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">O'er town and wold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That rest 'neath a softer sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swept that blast in anger by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in his wrathful eddies bore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fiery song of Odin and Thor.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Then little avail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">'Gainst the Vi-king's arm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The maiden's tear, the warrior's mail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or the priestman's charm.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And o'er the bright South-land</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A shadow of dread was the North wind's course,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whene'er his surging currents fanned</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The raven banner of the Norse.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Years pass, and time new rays has brought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet still the Northman's heart is warm;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But light on his soul a change has wrought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he loves the calm as he loved the storm.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Another god than the fearful Thor</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In heaven's blue he saw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he gave to Peace his might in war&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His anger to the law.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the strong hand holds the sickle now,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The anvil rings at morn;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waving sunbeams tinge with gold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The hues of the ripening corn.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the land he loves in peace has grown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To be mighty in wealth and name;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But o'er its brightness a cloud has flown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And evil men to its councils came.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all seemed locked in a deadly sleep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While treason walked in her halls of state,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And good men grieve, but hopeless weep,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the song of the scoffer is loud at the gate.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'The nation must pass away.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the Northman's blood is cold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And little he recks of honor or name,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If his hand may clutch the gold.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Work treason&mdash;work your will&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Divide our Fatherland;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hearts are craven, souls are base&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis fit for the traitor's hand.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Fear no more the Northman's rage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The blood of the Vi-kings is old and worn;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No ancient mem'ry can stir him now,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To stand by the flag his fathers have borne.'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The words half-sung in silence fall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hushed in dread by a mightier call,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That stays the hand&mdash;that throbs the heart;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cleaving the gloom, that wild war-note&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The traitor's foot is on your flag,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His bayonet at our throat.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hark! the North-wind's sullen moan</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rises high to a sterner tone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sinks away, then bursts anew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In joy, as 'mid its surges grew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shout, the stroke, the cannon's peal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The tread of countless number.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the flash of a traitor's steel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has broken the nation's slumber;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sighing breeze and southern gale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seized by the fierce wind's grasp, are torn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From gentle haunt by hill or dale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the whirling vortex borne.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There murm'ring on his hollow breast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wond'ring at his wild unrest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their shrieking echoes sounding far,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loud swelled the Northman's shout to war;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For with death's dark shadows flitting by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the day as dark as night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A nation's hands are raised on high</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To hold their ancient right.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the ages are rolled from the record of time;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the years of peace with its soft'ning beam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That soothed in love the Northman's heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are now but the mists of a warrior's dream.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the tinsel of life is burned in the glow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That flames in his heart as in years long ago,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Norman sea-kings swept the wave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who loved the night, the storm, and bloody grave.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And through all the blue of heaven's vault,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rolls the Vala's mystic charm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swelled with strains of the mighty past&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Victory strikes with the Northman's arm.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">F.</span></p>


<p>Truly the old Northman is not dead among us. He lived in the iron
Monitor, of the descendant of Eric, and he lives in scores of thousands
of brave hearts and strong arms who came and are still coming to the
battle-call:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Northmen, come out!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth into battle with storm and shout,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He who lives with victory's blest;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He who dies gains peaceful rest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Living or dying, let us be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still vowed to God and liberty!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Northmen, come out!'</span><br />

<p>The following poem is certainly <i>not</i> behind the times:</p>


<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><b>PAYING THE SHOT.</b></span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><b>BY J. IVES PEASE.</b></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yes, pay them! pay them in their chosen coin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bomb-shell and cannon-balls, well served and hot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ay, 'shell out' all the treasures of 'the mine,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Since that's the way we've got to 'pay the shot.'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We 'owe them <i>one</i>!' and now's the time to settle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And finish up the business to a dot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A half a million <i>men</i>, upon their <i>metal</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Accounts will soon square off, and 'pay the shot.'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We owe them one; but 'tisn't one for niggers;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Master or slave no more shall treason plot.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We've settled <i>that</i> account with steel and triggers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the two millions, daily, 'pay the shot.'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We owe them one for hemp, that, coil on coil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Judge Lynch has tendered us, in noose and knot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We've now a sort that's grown upon free soil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That, properly paid out, soon 'pays the shot.'</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's a snug sum due on the Sumner books;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That</i> must be paid, each tittle and each jot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A good accountant no mistake e'er brooks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But <i>strikes his balance</i> fair, and 'pays the shot.'</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's some old 'scores,' on tar-and-feather martyrs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We've now the 'devil to pay,' the 'pitch all hot;'</span><br />

<p>War stories and war songs are in vogue&mdash;for instance:</p>


<h4>MY JOHNNY IS GONE FOR A SOLDIER.</h4>

<p>The accomplished, fascinating, talented, and beautiful Miss H&mdash;&mdash;, as
Jinkings calls her in his last Saratoga letter, has engaged her
affections to Mr. John G&mdash;&mdash;, and they are to be married some time. In
the mean time, she has done all in her power to induce her lover to go
and fight the battles of his country; so far unsuccessfully, since Mr.
John G&mdash;&mdash; deems it his duty to stay at home and keep things steady,
especially billiards, which, as we all know, is an erratic game,
requiring great watching.</p>

<p>The other evening, Miss H&mdash;&mdash;, while assisting at a sociable at Madame
V&mdash;&mdash;'s, was asked to sing. Seated at the piano, to the horror of
expectant hearers of classic music, she began, with loudest voice, to
sing:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'I'll trace these gardins o'er and o'er,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A med-i-tating on atche swate flowir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thinking on each bewcheous hour;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! Johnny is gone for a sol-di-er.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>She then put her handkerchief to her eyes, pretended to sob bitterly,
arose from the piano-stool, and sought an arm-chair.</p>

<p>Solicited by her confidential friend, Miss Belrose, to confide her
affliction, she only answered:</p>

<p>'Oh! my Johnny G&mdash;&mdash;'s gone for a soldier&mdash;to play billiards with him!
And&mdash;and I know that that fast Lieutenant Gamble will keep him there for
hours and hours.'</p>

<p>Young gentlemen, this is the time for bullets and not for balls; for
cannons and not caroms; for rifle-pits to hole yourselves in, and not
for 'pockets' wherein to hole your adversary. <i>Apropos</i> of which, listen
to</p>


<h4>THE WRONG KIND OF A BAND.</h4>

<p>Colonel X&mdash;&mdash; raised a regiment in the Ri-too-lal Rural districts of
New-Jersey, including a by no means bad brass band.</p>

<p>Arrived in Washington with his force, he was unfortunate enough to meet
with a wag, who at once told him he was afraid that he, the Colonel,
would meet or rather come to grief shortly.</p>

<p>'How so?' asked Colonel X&mdash;&mdash; excitedly.</p>

<p>'H'm!' answered the wag, 'don't you see that those rural musicians of
yours will be regarded as country-band of war?'</p>

<p>The Colonel saw it!</p>

<h4>THE OLD SURGEON'S STORY.</h4>

<h4>BY ELEANOR C. DONELLY.</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas in a Southern hospital, a week ago or more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(God save us! how the days drag on, these weary times of war!)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They brought me, in the sultry noon, a youth whom they had found</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deserted by his regiment upon the battle-ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bleeding his young life away through many a gaping wound.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Dark-haired and slender as a girl, a handsome lad was he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Despite the pallor of his wounds, each one an agony.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A ball had carried off his arm, and zig-zag passage frayed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into his chest&mdash;so wild a rent that, when it was displayed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I, veteran surgeon that I was, turned white as any maid.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">''There is no hope?' he slowly said, noting my changing cheek;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I only shook my head: I dare not trust myself to speak;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in that wordless negative, the boy had read his doom,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And turned about, as best he could, and lay in silent gloom,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watching the summer sunlight make a glory of the room.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">''My little hero!' said a voice, and then a woman's hand</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay like a lily on his curls: 'God give you self-command!'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Mother!'&mdash;how full that thrilling word of pity and alarm&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'You here? my sweetest mother here?' and with his one poor arm</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He got about her neck and drew her down with kisses warm.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">''All the long, sultry night, when out&mdash;'(He shuddered as he said)&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'On yonder field I lay among the festering heaps of dead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With awful faces close to mine, and clots of bloody hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dead eyes gleaming through the dusk with such a rigid stare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all my pain, O mother mine! I only prayed one prayer.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">''Through all my pain&mdash;(and ne'er I knew what suffering was before!)&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I only prayed to see your face, to hear your voice once more;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cold moon shone into my eyes&mdash;my prayer seemed all in vain.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'My poor deluded boy!' she sobbed; her mother-fount of pain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'erflowing down her gentle cheeks in drops like thunder-rain.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">''Accursed be he whose cruel hand has wrought my son such ill!'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The boy sprang upright at the word, and shrieked aloud, 'Be still!</span><br />

<p>Such are the tragedies of civil war, the fearful probability of such
events. But who has not heard of families with sons in either army,
especially on the border, in Philadelphia, and Baltimore? We have heard
<i>seven</i> such instances enumerated by one lady of the former city. Let us
turn from tragedy to comedy:</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h4>CAPPED THE CLIMAX.</h4>

<p>The ladies of Christopher's Church, Philadelphia, have worked like
true-hearted women for the wounded soldiers. Many a poor fellow has
blessed them for their contributions to alleviate his pain and make the
old hospital comfortable for him. In the congregation, one elderly
maiden lady, who had so far given nothing, was called on by one of her
energetic sisters in the church, and implored to do something for the
poor soldiers. She was told that any thing that would render their
sufferings less would be gratefully received.</p>

<p>She promised to send a donation. Nothing more was heard from her for a
couple of weeks, when one morning the ladies assembled in the
vestry-room of the church received a large basket from the elderly
maiden lady. On opening it, they found three dozen starched muslin,
night-cape, with frills all round them, bows and long strings.</p>

<p>'Did you ever?' asked Miss G&mdash;&mdash;. 'I declare Miss&mdash;&mdash; has set her Caps
for the soldiers in earnest this time.</p>

<p>We select the following as the best proposed completion of the
unfinished poem by Fitz-James O'Brien, published in our July number:</p>

<p class='author'><i>Detroit, Mich., June 22d, 1862.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Editors of Continental</span>: As you do not give the conclusion
of that 'Watching the Stag,' I propose to finish it in this wise:</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Watching my face with half-closed eyes,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As I lean my head on the dappled stag</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That stiffens beneath a windward crag.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His flanks are black with the hardened sweat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And a film has clouded his eye of jet;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While a round, red wound that oozes still,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tells of his fate and my marksman's skill.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! the granite crags shall no longer feel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His fleet hoofs ringing like steel on steel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And shepherd shall never again espy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His antlers painted against the sky!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The mountain tarn, so lone and cold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The delicate shadow no more shall hold;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fleetness has died in each rigid limb,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And never shall dun hound follow him!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stanch Hela blinks as she half recalls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That savage chase through the mountain-walls,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And growls as she dreams how her white teeth sank</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a thirsty grip in his shuddering flank.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dream on, good dog! through the night so chill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till sunrise surges over the hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till the heather glows and the peaks are gay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then for our mountain-home hurra!</span><br />

<h2>THE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY.</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">The Continental Monthly</span> has passed its experimental ordeal, and stands
firmly established in popular regard. It was started at a period when
any new literary enterprise was deemed almost foolhardy, but the
publisher believed that the time had arrived for just such a Magazine.
Fearlessly advocating the doctrine of ultimate and gradual Emancipation,
for the sake of the UNION and the WHITE MAN, it has found favor in
quarters where censure was expected, and patronage where opposition only
was looked for. While holding firmly to its <i>own opinions</i>, it has
opened its pages to POLITICAL WRITERS <i>of widely different views</i>, and
has made a feature of employing the literary labors of the <i>younger</i>
race of American writers. How much has been gained by thus giving,
practically, the fullest freedom to the expression of opinion, and by
the infusion of fresh blood into literature, has been felt from month to
month in its constantly increasing circulation.</p>

<p>The most eminent of our Statesmen have furnished THE CONTINENTAL many of
its political articles, and the result is, it has not given labored
essays fit only for a place in ponderous encyclopedias, but fresh,
vigorous, and practical contributions on men and things as they exist.</p>

<p>It will be our effort to go on in the path we have entered, and as a
guarantee of the future, we may point to the array of live and brilliant
talent which has brought so many encomiums on our Magazine. The able
political articles which have given it so much reputation will be
continued in each issue, together with the new Novel by Richard B.
Kimball, the eminent author of the 'Under-Currents of Wall-Street,' 'St,
Leger,' etc., entitled,</p>

<h3>WAS HE SUCCESSFUL?</h3>

<p>An account of the Life and Conduct of Hiram Meeker, one of the leading
men in the mercantile community, and 'a bright and shining light' in the
Church, recounting what he did, and how he made his money. This work
excels the previous brilliant productions of this author. In the present
number is also commenced a new Serial by the author of 'Among the
Pines,' entitled,</p>

<h3>A MERCHANT'S STORY,</h3>

<p>which will depict Southern <i>white</i> society, and be a truthful history of
some eminent Northern merchants who are largely in 'the cotton trade and
sugar line.'</p>

<p>The UNION&mdash;The Union of ALL THE STATES&mdash;that indicates our politics. To
be content with no ground lower than the highest&mdash;that is the standard
of our literary character.</p>

<p>We hope all who are friendly to the spread of our political views, and
all who are favorable to the diffusion of a live, fresh, and energetic
literature, will lend us their aid to increase our circulation. There is
not one of our readers who may not influence one or two more, and there
is in every town in the loyal States some active person whose time might
be profitably employed in procuring subscribers to our work. To
encourage such to act for us we offer the following very liberal</p>

<h4>1,200,000 Acres, in Farms of 40, 80, 120, 160 Acres and upwards, in
ILLINOIS, the Garden State of America.</h4>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<blockquote><p>The Illinois Central Railroad Company offer, ON LONG CREDIT, the
beautiful and fertile PRAIRIE LANDS lying along the whole line of their
Railroad. 700 MILES IN LENGTH, upon the most Favorable Terms for
enabling Farmers, Manufacturers, Mechanics and Workingmen to make for
themselves and their families a competency, and a HOME they can call
THEIR OWN, as will appear from the following statements:</p></blockquote>

<h4>ILLINOIS.</h4>

<p>Is about equal in extent to England, with a population of 1,722,666, and
a soil capable of supporting 20,000,000. No State in the Valley of the
Mississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of
Illinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of
climate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great
staples, <span class="smcap">Corn</span> and <span class="smcap">Wheat</span>.</p>

<h4>CLIMATE.</h4>

<p>Nowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from
his labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much
ease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the
Terre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200
miles, is well adapted to Winter.</p>

<h4>WHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.</h4>

<p>Peaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is
grown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets
are furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate
vicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton &amp; St. Louis Railway and the
Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,
and 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising
portion of the State.</p>

<h4>THE ORDINARY YIELD</h4>

<p>of Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep
and Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is
believed that no section of country presents greater inducements for
Dairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to
which but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure
profitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and
Chicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147
miles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &amp;c., are
produced in great abundance.</p>

<h4>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.</h4>

<p>The Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any
other State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,
while the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the
crop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,
Pumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,
Sorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &amp;c., which go to swell the vast
aggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons
of produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.</p>

<h4>STOCK RAISING.</h4>

<p>In Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for
the extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,
Sheep, Hogs, &amp;c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large
fortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to
enter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also
presents its inducements to many.</p>

<h4>CULTIVATION OF COTTON.</h4>

<p>The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing
in latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption
on the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to
the perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young
children, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in
the growth and perfection of this plant.</p>

<h4>THE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD</h4>

<p>Traverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the
Mississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the
Railroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the
road along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.</p>

<h4>CITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.</h4>

<p>There are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one
every seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient
distances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity
may be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where
buyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.</p>

<h4>EDUCATION.</h4>

<p>Mechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by
the State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the
schools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the
church, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the
Great Western Empire.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
